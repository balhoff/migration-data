The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPA190''), [/gene/DDB_G0288449 rpc2] (''RPA135''), [/gene/DDB_G0268198 rpa43] (''RPA43''), [/gene/DDB_G0290909 rpa49] (''RPA49''), and [/gene/DDB_G0278263 rpa12] (''RPA12'') are unique to RNA polymerase I. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II.

Yeast has two additional subunits, ''RPA34'' and ''RPA14'', that do not have clear orthologs in other species, including in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12407181 Peyroche et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381659 Schramm and Hernandez 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-APR-2004 PG
DDB_G0268632	Petra Fey	The ''abpA'' gene encodes alpha-actinin, a 95 kD protein originally isolated from the cell cortex. It forms a dimer, crosslinks actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0051017/annotation/page/1 actin filament bundle formation]) into lateral arrays, and increases the actin-stimulated Mg ATPase of myosin. Both activities are regulated by Ca2+ [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6746725  (Condeelis et al. 1984)]. The alpha-actinin molecule carries two characteristic EF-hand structures. The calcium-binding loops form the structural basis for the calcium sensitivity ([/ontology/go/0005509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3622778  (Noegel et al. 1987)]. It was shown that EF hand I has a low affinity for Ca2+ and EF hand II a high affinity, implying a regulatory function of EF hand I in the inhibition of F-actin cross-linking activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8486739  (Witke et al. 1993)]. This was confirmed when the viscoelastic properties of F-actin solutions in the presence of mutated EF hand structures was tested, and it was concluded that the first EF hand of alpha-actinin is crucial for its crosslinking function [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8561496  (Janssen et al. 1996)].<br />The phenotype of an alpha-actinin mutant, HG1130, which retained only trace amounts of alpha-actinin, appeared to be normal [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3956480  (Wallraff et al. 1986)]. The lack of alpha-actinin was shown to only slightly affect cell substrate adhesion [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10411959  (Weber 1996)], growth and pinocytosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10413681  (Rivero et al. 1999)], and development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10704840  (Ponte et al. 2000)]. A redundancy in the microfilament system was suggested when two cytoskeletal genes, ''abpA'' and [/gene/DDB_G0269100 abpC], were disrupted. The loss of both proteins severely affected growth and resistance to osmotic stress. It also resulted in reduced motility and phagocytosis rates, and heavily impaired development. These changes were reversed by expressing either ''abpA'' or ''abpC'', showing the defects to be due to the absence of the two F-actin cross-linking proteins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1732064  (Witke et al. 1992)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8937986  (Rivero et al. 1996)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF
DDB_G0279417	Robert Dodson	The Roco family consists of multi-domain proteins that share three domains in common: the Roc domain (<u>R</u>as <u>o</u>f <u>c</u>omplex proteins), COR (<u>C</u>-terminal <u>o</u>f <u>R</u>oc), and a kinasedomain. Additionally, all Roco family members contain a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), with the exception of[/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]. Other domains found in Roco proteins include WD40 repeats, cNB/CNMP (cyclicnucleotide binding), PH (pleckstrin homology), and RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) domains ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14654223 Bosgraaf and Van Haastert 2003]).

DDB_G0268642	Karen Kestin	Initiation of protein translation in eukaryotes is regulated by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotictranslation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). During periods of amino acid starvation, eIF2alpha is inactivated viaphosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) GCN2 (general control nonderepressible), also known asPEK (pancreatic eukaryotic translation initiation factor kinase). The PEK family of protein kinases is highly conservedfrom yeast to humans, however, the effect on translation in metazoans is global whereas GCN2 in yeast acts to inhibittranslation of specific species of mRNA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7855893  reviewed in Wek 1994]).<br />In ''Dictyostelium'', two members of the PEK family of protein kinases have been identified: [/gene/DDB_G0272837 ifkA] and[/gene/DDB_G0276829 ifkB].

DDB_G0268020	Petra Fey	The oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine), is catalyzed by the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This mitochondrial enzyme contains 3 catalytic components, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a heterotetrameric alpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0286335 bkdA]), beta2 ([/gene/DDB_G0268020 bkdB]) enzyme, with 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase activity ().<br /> E2 is a homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyl transacylase ([/gene/DDB_G0281797 bkdC]) that forms the core of the multienzyme and binds to both E1 and E3 ([/ontology/go/5515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]). The lipoyl group of E2 is reductively 2-methylpropanoylated by E1, and then passes this 2-methylpropanoyl to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/8415/annotation/page/1 acyltransferase activity]). In addition to the 2-methylpropanoyl group, formed when E1 acts on the oxoacid that corresponds with valine, this enzyme also transfers the 3-methylbutanoyl and S-2-methylbutanoyl groups when E1 acts on the oxoacids corresponding with leucine and isoleucine, respectively.<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes. These include the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the glycine cleavage system, and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-DEC-2004 PF
DDB_G0271842	Petra Fey	 Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is an enzyme in the [/ontology/go/0006099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] that catalyzes the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with the concomitant hydrolysis of NTP to NDP and phosphate. There are two forms of the enzyme, using either ATP or GTP. The [/gene/DDB_G0289325 scsA] gene encodes the succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit. In eukaryotes one alpha and one beta subunit are thought to form a heterodimer. Anschutzt ''et al.'' determined that in crude [/ontology/go/0016020/annotation/page/1 membrane] extracts ScsA could be phosphorylated by ATP and GTP, but the purified enzyme showed high specificity for GTP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8448193  Anschutz et al., 1993]). <br />Only one alpha subunit has been identified in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7771809  Birney and Klein, 1995]). However, two beta subunits are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome; [/gene/DDB_G0274449 scsB] is the ortholog of GDP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits () and [/gene/DDB_G0271842 scsC] is highly similar to known ADP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits ().Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-JAN-2005 PF
DDB_G0270814	Karen Kestin	The NIMA (<u>n</u>ever <u>i</u>n <u>m</u>itosis) family of serine/threnonine protein kinases ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) wereoriginally identified in mitotic mutants of the fungus ''Aspergillus nidulans''. NIMA-related kinases havebeen cloned in several vertebrates, however, ''nek2'' represents the first identified non-vertebrate Nek2 kinase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11956323 (Graf 2002)].<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11956323 Graf (2002)] demostrates that ''Dictyostelium'' Nek2 localizes to the microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) ([/ontology/go/0005813/annotation/page/1 centrosome]), although acytoplasmic ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]) pool of Nek2 also exists, similar to its vertebrate counterpart. Overexpression of a ''GFP:nek2'' fusion constructresults in abnormal nuclear morphology and supernumerary MTOCs ([/ontology/go/0007098/annotation/page/1 centrosome cycle]). Overexpression of a series ofdeletion constructs results in a supernumerary MTOC phenotype only when the C-terminal domain is expressed and not when thecatalytic kinase domain alone is expressed. This implies a centrosome nucleation function for the C-terminal domain([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11956323 Graf 2002]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-APR-2004 KP

DDB_G0271564	Karen Kestin	The net reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the tricarboxylic acidcycle (TCA).

E2 ([/gene/DDB_G0277847 pdhC]) forms the core of thecomplex and possesses dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase activity ([/ontology/go/0004742/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase activity]).

In addition, the pyruvatedehydrogenase complex contains component X ([/gene/DDB_G0271564 pdhX]) that binds E3 ([/ontology/go/0005515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]) and has an apparent structural rolein the complex (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9399911 Aral et al. 1997]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-DEC-2004 KP
DDB_G0270884	Petra Fey	Actobindin has been characterized in ''Acanthamoeba castellanii'' where it was shown to bind to two actin monomers ([/ontology/go/0003779/annotation/page/1 actin binding]) at high concentrations of G-actin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2376577  (Vandekerckhove et al. 1990)]. Actobindins are small proteins with two actin-binding WH2 (Wiskott Aldrich syndrome homology region 2) domains. ''Dictyostelium'' has three genes encoding actobindin, [/gene/DDB_G0270884 abnA], [/gene/DDB_G0269518 abnB], and [/gene/DDB_G0269520 abnC]. While proteins are identical for ''abnB'' and ''abnC'', both are 72% identical to ''abnA''. All three ''Dictyostelium'' actobindins are 50 to 51% identical to the ''Acanthamoeba'' protein.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-APR-2005 PF
DDB_G0269222	Pascale Gaudet	''gefB'' encodes RasGEFB, a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor ([/ontology/go/0005085/annotation/page/1 guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity]), ([/ontology/go/0007265/annotation/page/1 Ras protein signal transduction]). ''Dictyostelium'' cells in which the ''gefB'' gene is disrupted move unusually rapidly ([/ontology/go/0051271/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of cell motility]), but are unable to perform macropinocytosis ([/ontology/go/0045807/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of endocytosis]) and therefore to grow in liquid medium. Mutant cells form few, small but normally proportioned fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). This defect correlates with loss of discoidin Igamma ([/gene/DDB_G0273065 dscC-1]) mRNA, a starvation-induced gene. Other genes required for development are expressed normally or even precociously ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11102804 Wilkins et al. 2000]). <br />Since ''gefB-'' mutants have a phenotype highly similar to that of [/gene/DDB_G0283537 rasS]- cells, it has been proposed that [/gene/DDB_G0269222 gefB] is the principal activator of the RasS protein [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11102804 (Wilkins et al. 2000)]; although there are differences in their motility defect ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12211111 Chubb et al. 2002]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-NOV-2004 PG
DDB_G0269234	Pascale Gaudet	There are 29 genes encoding actin in ''Dictyostelium'' with amino acid identity greater than 83%, ''act1''-''act29''.

The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0269242	Petra Fey	The ''fcsA'' gene was identified by screening expression libraries with monoclonal antibodies raised against purified phagosomal proteins. The gene encodes the LC FACS 1 protein, an enzyme with [/ontology/go/0004467/annotation/page/1 long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase activity] and has been shown to localize to the cytosolic surface ([/ontology/go/0010009/annotation/page/1 external side of endosome membrane]) of the [/ontology/go/0005769/annotation/page/1 early endosome]. Long chain fatty acid acyl-CoA synthesases catalyse the formation of a thiester bond between a free fatty acid and coenzyme A during [/ontology/go/0006631/annotation/page/1 fatty acid metabolic process]. In a ''fcsA'' null mutant, growth development, phagocytosis, and macropinocytosis are all normal, however, fatty acid accumulation is strongly reduced. This suggests that the LC FACS 1 enzyme plays a role in the retrieval of fatty acids from the lumen of phagosomes into the cytosol [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14629118  (von Loehneysen et al., 2003)]. <br />Searching the cDNA database identified a gene, ([/gene/DDB_G0269474 fcsB]), coding for a protein which is 40% identical to LC FACS 1 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14629118  (von Loehneysen et al., 2003)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAR-2005 PF
DDB_G0269244	Petra Fey	The ''atg6'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495  (Otto et al., 2003)]. Macroautophagy ([/ontology/go/0016236/annotation/page/1 macroautophagy]) is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. In ''atg6''-null cells, survival during nitrogen starvation ([/ontology/go/0006995/annotation/page/1 cellular response to nitrogen starvation]) is reduced.. Upon starvation mutant cells show little turnover of cellular components. Development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) of the mutant is slightly impaired. On bacterial lawns cells aggregate mainly in the center of plaques and not in the periphery, and multi-tipped aggregates form very small fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). Axenically grown cells plated on filters form multi-tipped aggregates that develop into small fruiting bodies with truncated stalks. These fruiting bodies produce few viable, detergent-resistent spores ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]). Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the atg6 mutation is autonomous. The phenotype of the ''atg6''-null mutant is almost identical to that of the [/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8]-null mutant. Both mutants have the mildest defects when compared to [/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1], [/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5], and [/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7] mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736886  (Otto et al., 2004)]Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-SEP-2004 PF
DDB_G0269248	Pascale Gaudet	Developing ''Dictyostelium'' cells aggregate to form fruiting bodies containing typically 2 x 10(4) cells.

The breakup is regulated by a secreted complex of polypeptides called counting factor (CF) ([/ontology/go/0005576/annotation/page/1 extracellular region]). CF is composed of at least 5 polypeptides, including Countin (encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] gene), [/gene/DDB_G0273175 cf50-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0269248 cf45-1]. Disrupting the CF45-1 gene results in the formation of large groups when cells are grown with bacteria on agar plates and then starve ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). However, unlike countin(-) and CF50(-) cells, CF45-1(-) cells sometimes form smaller groups than wild-type cells when the cells are starved on filter pads. In the exudates from starved cells, CF45-1 is present in a approximately 450-kDa fraction that also contains countin and CF50, suggesting that it is part of a complex. Recombinant CF45-1 decreases group size in colonies of CF45-1(-) cells, as well as in colonies of wild-type and CF50(-) cells. Like countin(-) and CF50(-) cells, CF45-1(-) cells have high levels of cytosolic glucose ([/ontology/go/0042593/annotation/page/1 glucose homeostasis]), high cell-cell adhesion ([/ontology/go/0016337/annotation/page/1 cell-cell adhesion]), and low cell motility ([/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motility]). Together, the data suggest that CF45-1 participates in group size regulation ([/ontology/go/0004871/annotation/page/1 signal transducer activity])[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12912898 (Brock et al. 2003)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-OCT-2003 PG

In yeast, TFIIA is dispensable for accurate initiation of transcription but plays an important role in transcriptional activation, functioning as either an antirepressor or a coactivator. <br /> Human TFIIA and Drosophila TFIIA are composed of three subunits. The two larger subunits (alpha and beta) are encoded by the same gene and appear to be posttranslationally modified forms of a precursor protein. In yeast, two genes TOA1 and TOA2 are homologs of the large and the small subunits, respectively (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). In ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0290327 gtf2a1] encodes the large (alpha/beta) subunits and [/gene/DDB_G0285343 gtf2a2] encodes the small (gamma) subunit.

DDB_G0275029	Petra Fey	The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>. It contains multiple copies of 3 enzymatic components: E1, E2, and E3. E1 ([/gene/DDB_G0280353 odhA]) has 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (). Multiple copies of E1 are bound to a core of dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2), which also binds multiple copies of lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). The lipoyl group of E2 ([/gene/DDB_G0275029 odhB]) is reductively succinylated by E1, and then passes this succinyl group to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/4149/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase activity]).<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes. These include the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the glycine cleavage system, and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-DEC-2004 PF

DDB_G0278157	Petra Fey	Succinate dehydrogenase, also known as complex II ([/ontology/go/5749/annotation/page/1 mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II]), catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate while FAD is reduced to FADH<sub>2</sub>. The enzyme contains 4 subunits: a flavoprotein (FP) ([/gene/DDB_G0280535 sdhA]), an iron-sulfur protein (IP) ([/gene/DDB_G0270120 sdhB]), and a cytochrome b composed of two integral membrane proteins ([/ontology/go/16021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]) ([/gene/DDB_G0275115 sdhC] and [/gene/DDB_G0278157 sdhD]). The 4 subunit complex is bound in the [/ontology/go/5740/annotation/page/1 mitochondrial envelope] and provides a link between the the [/ontology/go/6099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] and the membrane-bound [/ontology/go/6118/annotation/page/1 electron transport] system.

DDB_G0278971	Pascale Gaudet	''dimA'' encodes a bZIP/bRLZ transcription factor. The ''dimA'' null mutant shows similar developmental defects to the [/gene/DDB_G0289329 dmtA] null mutant, which is defective in DIF-1 synthesis. The mutants exhibit abnormal [/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis], producing fruiting bodies with long, thin stalks, have defective prestalkO cell differentiation, and increased number of prespore cells, indicating that DimA and DmtA are involved in [/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation]. ''dimA'' has been proposed to be a transcriptional regulator required to integrate DIF-1 signaling and subsequent patterning during ''Dictyostelium'' development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14729573 Thompson et al. 2004]). Interestingly, although ''dimA'' mutants make more prespore cells, in chimeras with wild type cells they actually produce fewer spores. Therefore, loss of ''dimA'' is deleterious for [/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470429 Foster et al. 2004]).<br />The eukaryotic basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors ([/ontology/go/0006355/annotation/page/1 regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent]) are proteins that dimerize through their leucine repeats to form a coiled coil with two flanking alpha-helices that constitute the basic region that binds DNA ([/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding])[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11017199 (Fujii et al. 2000)]. There are 19 putative bZIP transcription factors in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0278971 dimA], [/gene/DDB_G0284023 bzpL], [/gene/DDB_G0290173 bzpI], [/gene/DDB_G0282749 bzpG], [/gene/DDB_G0290169 bzpO], [/gene/DDB_G0274993 bzpJ], [/gene/DDB_G0291372 dimB], [/gene/DDB_G0286411 bzpN], [/gene/DDB_G0288705 bzpQ], [/gene/DDB_G0290171 bzpS], [/gene/DDB_G0290303 bzpP], [/gene/DDB_G0269338 bzpE], [/gene/DDB_G0278379 bzpD], [/gene/DDB_G0279529 bzpF], [/gene/DDB_G0290165 bzpR], [/gene/DDB_G0282047 bzpM], [/gene/DDB_G0282049 bzpK], [/gene/DDB_G0277681 bzpH], and [/gene/DDB_G0279439 bzpC].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-APR-2004 PG
DDB_G0275445	Pascale Gaudet	Members of the Myb family of transcription factors are typically composed of two orthree imperfect repeats each of about 50 amino acids. These repeats fold into a variant ofthe helix-turn-helix motif and bind DNA ([/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding]).The Myb motif has been well conserved during evolution (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999] and references therein).<br />''mybB'' was isolated a REMI mutant that does not aggregate upon starvation ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). It has undetectable levels of [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA] transcript and no cAMP production. The expression pattern of ''mybB'' is consistent with its role in early development, peaking 2 hours after starvation. MybB functions in [/ontology/go/0043193/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of gene-specific transcription], being specifically required for the induction of adenylate cyclase expression in early development. Adenylate cyclase is responsible for cAMP production which mediates signaling during development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9620859 Otsuka and Van Haastert 1998]).Overexpression of ''mybB'' rescues the developmental arrest of [/gene/DDB_G0282375 amiB] cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10651904 Kon et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-MAY-2004 PG
DDB_G0275451	Karen Kestin	The ''alxA'' gene was identified as a homolog of mammalian Alix (<u>AL</u>G-2-<u>i</u>nteracting protein <u>X</u>, alsoreferred to as AIP1), which interacts with ALG-2 (<u>a</u>poptosis-<u>l</u>inked <u>g</u>ene 2). Mammalian Alix is known tobe involved in many biological processes, including apoptosis, membrane trafficking, and budding of the HIV virus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15276209 Ohkouchi et al. 2004]). Murine Alix has been shown to interact with ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0291081 pefA], a calcium-binding EF hand protein similar to mammalian ALG-2, but not with [/gene/DDB_G0293530 pefB] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al. 2002]). The ''alxA'' transcript and encoded protein are expressed throughout development, with higer levels duringgrowth and early development and slightly lower expression during culmination. Immunoflourescence experiments showthat the AlxA protein localizes to the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm] and to the [/ontology/go/0005768/annotation/page/1 endosome] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15708561 Mattei et al. 2005]).<br />The ''alxA'' null mutant shows no significant phenotype under normal conditions, however, mutant cells display developmentalabnormalities in the presence of LiCl and in low concentrations of Ca2+. In the presence of 5 mM LiCl, ''alxA-'' cellsarrest at the loose aggregate stage or form fruiting body-like structures at the apex of aggregates ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). Similarly, ''alxA''null cells arrest at the aggregate stage in the presence of 200&amp;micro;M TMB-8, an antagonist of intracellular Ca2+, and inthe presence of a low concentration of Ca2+. Developmental arrest is of course seen in wild-type cells in the absence offree Ca2+, however, ''alxA-'' cells are hypersensitive to a reduction in free Ca2+ compared to wild-type. Thissuggests that AlxA is somehow involved in calcium signaling in the developmental program, which is interesting in light of thecalcium binding activities of ''Dictyostelium'' PefA and PefB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15276209 Ohkouchi et al. 2004], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001]).<br />A second mutant constructed and analyzed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15708561 Mattei et al. (2005)] showssimilar gross phenotypes. At the cellular level, ''alxA-'' cells suppress spore formation ([/ontology/go/0045881/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of sporulation])and promote differentiation into PstB cells, as shown by almost ubiquitous expression of the prestalk markers[/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], and [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC] in migrating slugs.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0274811	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' ArgB is similar to bacterial argB proteins with [/ontology/go/3991/annotation/page/1 acetylglutamate kinase activity], which catalyze the second step in [/ontology/go/6526/annotation/page/1 arginine biosynthetic process]. This protein has the characteristical C-terminal region found also in ''Neurospora crassa'' and other fungal acetylglutamate synthases (EC: 2.7.2.8), and is predicted to have a mitochondrial target sequence.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-FEB-2005 PF
DDB_G0276043	Karen Kestin	Initiation of protein translation in eukaryotes is regulated by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotictranslation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). During periods of amino acid starvation, eIF2alpha is inactivated viaphosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) GCN2 (general control nonderepressible), also known asPEK (pancreatic eukaryotic translation initiation factor kinase). The PEK family of protein kinases is highly conservedfrom yeast to humans, however, the effect on translation in metazoans is global whereas GCN2 in yeast acts to inhibittranslation of specific species of mRNA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7855893  reviewed in Wek 1994]).<br />In ''Dictyostelium'', two members of the PEK family of protein kinases have been identified: [/gene/DDB_G0272837 ifkA] and[/gene/DDB_G0276829 ifkB]. Putative proteins belonging to the PEK family are: [/gene/DDB_G0276043 ifkC], [/gene/DDB_G0283065 DDB_G0283065], [/gene/DDB_G0268642 DDB_G0268642], [/gene/DDB_G0292734 DDB_G0292734], and [/gene/DDB_G0292734 DDB_G0292734].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0273059	Karen Kestin	Members of the casein kinase I (CK1) family ([/ontology/go/0004681/annotation/page/1 casein kinase I activity]) of serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in manycellular processes. Casein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate the 14-3-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) protein inmammals, play a role in Wnt signaling in ''Xenopus laevis'' and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', and maintaincircadian rhythms in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. Additionally, CK1 plays a role in DNA repair ([/ontology/go/0006281/annotation/page/1 DNA repair])in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).<br />Two casein kinase I family members have been identified in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', ''cak1'' and [/gene/DDB_G0292354 DDB_G0292354]. Cak1 is highly similar to CK1s in yeast and in metazoans. DDB0216336 is a putative caseinkinase I that is highly similar to the CK1 subfamily tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12471243 Manninget al. 2002]). The Cak1 protein has been shown to phosphorylate casein when it is expressed in''E. coli'' cells, and localizes to both the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]) and the nucleus ([/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]) inimmunofluorescence assays. Null mutations and overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Cak1 fail to produce viable cells, indicating that this protein may be essential for growth.Overexpression of wild-type Cak1 results in decreased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea; this suggests a role for Cak1 in DNA repair ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-MAY-2004 KP

DDB_G0274599	Pascale Gaudet	There are 29 genes encoding actin in ''Dictyostelium'' with amino acid identity greater than 83%, ''act1''-''act29''.

The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0275695	Petra Fey	The ''ampA'' gene encodes a novel anti-adhesive-like protein ([/ontology/go/0007155/annotation/page/1 cell adhesion]) that inhibits premature cell agglutination during growth. The AmpA protein also modulates cell-cell ([/ontology/go/0016337/annotation/page/1 cell-cell adhesion]) and cell-substrate adhesion during development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]), when much of the protein is found extracellularly ([/ontology/go/0005576/annotation/page/1 extracellular region]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11884033  (Varney et al. 2002)]. During development ''ampA''-expressing cells are initially scattered throughout the entire aggregate. By the tip formation stage, however, the majority of ''ampA''-expressing cells are localized to the mound periphery, with only a few cells remaining scattered in the upper portion of the mound. In the final culminant, ''ampA'' is expressed only in the upper cup, lower cup, and basal disc [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11963653  (Casademunt et al. 2002)]. Analysis of cell type specific reporter gene expression during development of the ''ampA''-null strain identifies patterning defects that define two distinct roles for the AmpA protein in specifying cell fate ([/ontology/go/0007389/annotation/page/1 pattern specification process]). In the absence of a functional ''ampA''gene, cells prematurely specify as prespore cells, and prestalk cell differentiation and migration are delayed ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11973270  (Varney et al. 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PF
DDB_G0275699	Karen Kestin	An [/ontology/go/0008375/annotation/page/1 acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity] was originally identified in the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm] by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10593934 Teng-umnuay andcolleagues (1999)].

The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPA190''), [/gene/DDB_G0288449 rpc2] (''RPA135''), [/gene/DDB_G0268198 rpa43] (''RPA43''), [/gene/DDB_G0290909 rpa49] (''RPA49''), and [/gene/DDB_G0278263 rpa12] (''RPA12'') are unique to RNA polymerase I. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II. Subunits [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], and [/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12] are common to all three RNA polymerases. Yeast has two additional subunits, ''RPA34'' and ''RPA14'', that do not have clear orthologs in other species, including in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12407181 Peyroche et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381659 Schramm and Hernandez 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-APR-2004 PG
DDB_G0276945	Petra Fey	In search for ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin adaptor complexes (APs) cDNAs ''apm4'', [/gene/DDB_G0289247 apm1], and [/gene/DDB_G0277901 apm3], encoding proteins homologous to mammalian medium chain (mu) subunits, have been cloned. All APs are comprised of two large subunits, one medium size subunit, and one small subunit. ''Apm4'' encodes the medium chain of AP-4 ([/ontology/go/0030124/annotation/page/1 AP-4 adaptor complex]), which seems to be associated with the Golgi apparatus ([/ontology/go/0005794/annotation/page/1 Golgi apparatus]). The ''apm4'' protein (mu4) is 26% identical with the human mu4A, and is slightly larger (59 kD versus 50 kD). However, the existance of several other partial sequences homologous to AP-4 complexes in the ''Dictyostelium'' database and the presence of conserved residues potentially interacting with tyrosine-based sorting signals suggest that ''amp4'' truly encodes an AP-4 medium chain. Expression of ''apm4'' is developmentally regulated, sharply increasing at 12 hours, and peaking at 16 hours development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11179674  (de Chassey et al., 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF
DDB_G0276947	Karen Kestin	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-assocated protein 1 (TRAP1) plays a role in many cellular processes, suchas cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis, however, its exact molecular function is unknown.First identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12372338 Morita and colleagues (2002)], the ''Dictyostelium'' Trap1 protein localizes to the [/ontology/go/0030864/annotation/page/1 cortical actin cytoskeleton]. During theprestarvation response, Trap1 translocates to the [/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion], a process that is induced byhigh cell density and by conditioned medium, indicating that an extracellular factor regulates this process. Trap1 has also been observed in the [/ontology/go/0005730/annotation/page/1 nucleolus] and [/ontology/go/0031160/annotation/page/1 spore wall] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652353 Yamaguchi et al. 2005]).<br />Inantisense RNA experiments, the reduction of Trap1 protein results in reduced growth rate and delayed development([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15507488 Morita et al. 2004]). Cells overexpressing Trap1 exhibitprecocious aggregation, however, development arrests before the tight mound stage. Changes in Trap1 expressionaffect the expression of [/gene/DDB_G0280531 lagC], [/gene/DDB_G0289073 csaA], and the prestarvation genes [/gene/DDB_G0285431 dia1] and ''dia3'', but not [/gene/DDB_G0273063 dscA-1] or [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1].

Further analysis of trap1-RNAi cells shows defects in [/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation] and in resistance to heat shock, an indication that Trap1 does in fact function as a chaperone, as its membership in the HSP90 family suggests.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-NOV-2004 KP
DDB_G0274601	Pascale Gaudet	There are 29 genes encoding actin in ''Dictyostelium'' with amino acid identity greater than 83%, ''act1''-''act29''. Seventeen of these genes encode identical proteins: [/gene/DDB_G0289553 act1], [/gene/DDB_G0274133 act2], [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8], [/gene/DDB_G0274601 act9], [/gene/DDB_G0288879 act11], [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12], [/gene/DDB_G0274599 act13], [/gene/DDB_G0274137 act14], [/gene/DDB_G0272520 act15], [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16], [/gene/DDB_G0274727 act19], [/gene/DDB_G0274285 act20], and [/gene/DDB_G0274561 act21], while [/gene/DDB_G0289811 act10], [/gene/DDB_G0275023 act22], and [/gene/DDB_G0289487 act3] respectively have 1, 4 and 11 amino acid differences compared to the 17 identical genes. The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0276155	Petra Fey	The ''spnA'' gene was identified as a developmentally essential gene in a REMI screen. SpnA- cells aggregate and form mounds but fail to continue through morphogenesis ([/ontology/go/0006953/annotation/page/1 acute-phase response]). However, at 16 hours of development the mounds disaggregate to eventually form many small finger-like structures. Analysis of cell-type differentiation ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]) showed that SpnA function is cell autonomous for prestalk differentiation, and cell non-autonomous for prespore differentiation.<br />''SpnA,'' encodes a bimodular protein with an N-terminal domain that shares substantial sequence homology with the heterotrimeric Galpha subunit family of GTP binding proteins ([/ontology/go/0005525/annotation/page/1 GTP binding]). The C-terminal domain shows strong homology to the Ser/Thr phosphatases of the PPC2 class. SpnA was shown to have Ser/Thr phosphatase activity ([/ontology/go/0004722/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity]) in vitro, and mutational analysis identified the PPC2 domain to be essential for spnA function. The Galpha-like domain, on the other hand, seems to be required for ''spnA'' regulation and its targeting to membrane ruffles ([/ontology/go/0001726/annotation/page/1 ruffle]). These results suggest that spnA works as a GTP-regulated molecular switch in ''Dictyostelium'' development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9585512  (Aubry and Firtel, 1998)].

DDB_G0277539	Karen Kestin	The wee1 family of tyrosine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004713/annotation/page/1 protein-tyrosine kinase activity]) were originally identified in a screen formutants that undergo mitosis at a reduced cell size in the fission yeast ''Schizosaccharomycespombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7262540 Nurse and Thuriaux 1980]). Since then, members ofthe wee1 family have been shown to play an essential role in cell cycle regulation ([/ontology/go/0000074/annotation/page/1 regulation of progression through cell cycle]) in several other organisms, including thebudding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', the African clawed frog ''Xenopus laevis'', andseveral metazoans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Wee1 phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue on the mitosis promoting protein Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 ([/gene/DDB_G0272813 cdk1] in ''Dictyostelium''). Phosphorylation of this residue by Wee1 inhibits Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28,thereby delaying entry into mitosis from G2. Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 is inactivated by dephosphorylation of thetyrosine residue by the phosphatase Cdc25/Mih1 ([/gene/DDB_G0283617 cdc25] in ''Dictyostelium''), allowingentry into mitosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Three uncharacterized putative wee1 family members exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0291842 DDB_G0291842], [/gene/DDB_G0277539 DDB_G0277539], and [/gene/DDB_G0291133 DDB_G0291133].

DDB_G0275573	Karen Kestin	Vps (Vacuolar Protein Sorting, named Snf7 in yeast and CHMP4 in human) proteins are involved in vesicle traffickingin yeast and in metazoans. Vps32 is an E class Vps involved in endosomal maturation (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10873832 Lemmon and Traub 2000]) and is a member of the [/ontology/go/0000815/annotation/page/1 ESCRT III complex] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12194857 Babst et al. 2002]).

DDB_G0277861	Petra Fey	PAT1 is a calcium-translocating P-type ATPase ([/ontology/go/0005388/annotation/page/1 calcium-transporting ATPase activity]), the type IIB ATPase which is responsible for translocating calcium ions across the plasma membrane ([/ontology/go/0006816/annotation/page/1 calcium ion transport]). ''Dictyostelium'' PAT1 is very similar to other Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases of the plasma membrane, and ''patA'' gene expression is upregulated when cells are grown in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-rich medium. The rate of intracellular P-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is also increased ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7499325 Moniakis et al., 1995]). Upregulation of ''patA'' expression is strongly reduced when the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin ([/gene/DDB_G0276883 canA], [/gene/DDB_G0267446 cnbA]) was inhibited, suggesting the regulation of PAT1 by calcineurin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9885293 Moniakis et al., 1999]).<br />PAT1-deficient cells, due to antisense expression of ''patA'' RNA or to the presence of calcineurin inhibitors, grow normally in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> medium but poorly in high Ca<sup>2+</sup> medium. PAT1 colocalizes with calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) to the [/ontology/go/0031164/annotation/page/1 contractile vacuolar membrane] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7499325 Moniakis et al., 1995]), and also localizes to the [/ontology/go/0005886/annotation/page/1 plasma membrane]. These findings suggest that the contractile vacuole fuses with the plasma membrane to eliminate excess intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9885293 Moniakis et al., 1999]).

DDB_G0279911	Pascale Gaudet	NdkM is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ([/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion]) NDP kinase ([/ontology/go/0004550/annotation/page/1 nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity])[/ontology/go/0009142/annotation/page/1 nucleoside triphosphate biosynthetic process]. Isolated ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' mitochondria contain 3% of the total cellular NDP kinase activity.

DDB_G0278735	Karen Kestin	Bisphosphonates are used to treat various bone diseases, including osteoporosis and hypercalcemia. The effects ofbisphosphonate drugs on ''Dictyostelium'' resemble the effects on osteoclasts, making ''Dictyostelium'' anideal system in which to study bisphosphonates, particularly because osteoclasts are difficult to culture([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15332174 reviewed in Rogers 2004]). After some experimentation, it was discoveredthat the target for these drugs is [/gene/DDB_G0278735 fps] ([/ontology/go/0045337/annotation/page/1 farnesyl diphosphate biosynthetic process]).

DDB_G0278737	Karen Kestin	The ''rckA'' gene, identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12686622 Sun and Firtel (2003)], encodes a protein that contains anRGS (regulator of G protein signaling) domain and a protein kinase domain ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) that is similar to bothserine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. The ''rckA'' transcript is expressed at very low levels in vegetative cells, has a sharpincrease at 4 h and a sharp decline immediately after that point. A myc-tagged RckA resides in the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]),however, in response to a cAMP gradient, the protein translocates to the cell cortex ([/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex]).<br />Disruption of the ''rckA'' gene results in precocious aggregation, however, slug formation is delayed. Conversely, cellsoverexpressing ''rckA'' have delayed aggregation. Expression of the cAMP receptor [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1] is not affected in mutantcells, however, expression of the cell-type-specific markers [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC], [/gene/DDB_G0289075 spiA], [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], and[/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB] is delayed. Expression of RckA bearing key point mutations in the RGS and kinase domains results in aphenotype similar to ''rckA-'' cells. Interestingly, expression of RckA-E510G (a single mutation in the RGS domain) in ''rckA-'' cells functions to complement the null phenotype. This suggests that RckA-E510G has a low level of activity compared towild-type RckA. In addition to developmental defects, ''rckA-'' cells exhibit an increased rate of chemotaxis toward a cAMPgradient, while ''rckA'' overexpressors have a reduced rate.<br />In an attempt to elucidate the underlying signaling pathway in which RckA works, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12686622 Sun and Firtel (2003)] investigated interaction with several signaling molecules. The phosphatidylinositol pathway does not appear to berelated as shown with experiments involving [/gene/DDB_G0278727 pikA], [/gene/DDB_G0283081 pikB], and [/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA]. RckA does in factinteract genetically with G protein alpha subunits ([/ontology/go/0007189/annotation/page/1 G-protein signaling, adenylate cyclase activating pathway]). In [/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB] (G&amp;alpha;2) null cells, the RckA proteindoes not translocate to the membrane, nor does it retain kinase activity. In contrast, translocation and kinase activity areunchanged in [/gene/DDB_G0286185 gpaE] (G&amp;alpha;5) null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12686622 Sun and Firtel 2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 03-DEC-2004 KP

Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II. Subunits [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], and [/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12] are common to all three RNA polymerases. Yeast has two additional subunits, ''RPA34'' and ''RPA14'', that do not have clear orthologs in other species, including in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12407181 Peyroche et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381659 Schramm and Hernandez 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 13-APR-2004 PG
DDB_G0277833	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' cofilin was identified through a search for actin monomer binding proteins ([/ontology/go/0003785/annotation/page/1 actin monomer binding]) in whole cell lysates. A 15 kDa protein was isolated and purified, which was shown to depolimerize actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0030042/annotation/page/1 actin filament depolymerization]) in a dose-dependent manner and to decrease the viscosity of actin filaments. This activity was inhibited by phosphatidylinositides. Cloning the cofilin gene resulted in the identification of 2 identical genes, ''cofA'' and [/gene/DDB_G0291970 cofB] that differed only in their intron and promoter sequence. When promoter activities were tested, only ''cofA'' was found to be expressed, predominantly in vegetative cells. No promoter activity was detected for ''cofB'', suggesting that ''cofB'' might be a pseudogene. Attempts to delete the ''cofA'' gene failed, while deletion of ''cofB'' yielded mutants with no detectable phenotype. This confirmed that ''cofB'' is not expressed and suggested that ''cofA'' is an essential gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7738034  (Aizawa et al., 1995) ]. <br />Overexpression of ''cofA'' was shown to stimulate bundling of actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0051017/annotation/page/1 actin filament bundle formation]) in alpha-actinin ([/gene/DDB_G0268632 abpA]) -induced actin latticeworks, probably by severing the filaments [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636212  (Aizawa et al., 1996) ]. In overexpressing cells also showed that cofilin, together with the actin-interacting protein [/gene/DDB_G0278733 DAip1], plays a pivotal role in reorganizing the actin bundles in response to hyperosmotic stress ([/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10421841  (Aizawa et al., 1999) ]. To investigate the actin depolimerization activity of cofilin further, Ichetovkin ''et al.'' showed, by two independent methods, that both native and recombinant cofilin sever actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response]), but to different extents [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10744862  (Ichetovkin et al., 2000) ].<br />Recently, cofilin was found to be dependent on the MADS box transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA]. The authors found an expression profile of cofilin that differed from that published for ''cofA''. While ''cofA'' expression was originally tested by promoter activity and later confirmed by western blot, this analysis was done by Northern blot. As a consequence of the discrepancy the authors referred in their paper not to cofilin A, but to the identical cofilin B ([/gene/DDB_G0291970 cofB]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15075287  (Escalante et al., 2004) ].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-MAY-2004 PF
DDB_G0277847	Karen Kestin	The net reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the tricarboxylic acidcycle (TCA). The complex contains three enzymes, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a pyruvate dehydrogenase () that consists ofan alpha subunit [/gene/DDB_G0292994 pdhA] and a beta subunit [/gene/DDB_G0276417 pdhB]. E2 ([/gene/DDB_G0277847 pdhC]) forms the core of thecomplex and possesses dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase activity ([/ontology/go/0004742/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase activity]). The E3 enzyme [/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd] is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/0004148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes and the glycine cleavage system. In addition, the pyruvatedehydrogenase complex contains component X ([/gene/DDB_G0271564 pdhX]) that binds E3 ([/ontology/go/0005515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]) and has an apparent structural rolein the complex (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9399911 Aral et al. 1997]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-DEC-2004 KP

The ''Dictyotelium'' gene encoding GMP synthetase, ''guaA'', has been cloned.

DDB_G0279193	Pascale Gaudet	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates ([/ontology/go/0003899/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity]). Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase II is composed of 12 subunits: [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1], [/gene/DDB_G0288257 rpb2], [/gene/DDB_G0292244 rpb3], [/gene/DDB_G0282739 rpb4], [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0284891 rpb7], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0268306 rpb9], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], [/gene/DDB_G0277677 rpb11], and[/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12]. Subunits 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are common to all threeRNA polymerases. <br />A unique feature of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit is thepresence of tandem repeats of a heptapeptide sequence at its carboxy-terminus. This carboxy-terminal repeat domain(CTD) has the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser is highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms. Althoughthe CTD is a ubiquitous feature of RNA pol II, the repeat length varies.It probably projects out of the globular catalytic domain and may interact with the acidic activator domains of transcriptional regulatory proteins. It is also known to bind by intercalation to DNA. RNA polymerase II is activated by phosphorylation at the serine and threonine residues in the CTD (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-APR-2004 PG
DDB_G0280047	Petra Fey	The ''yelA'' gene was isolated from REMI mutant DG1014. This developmental gene has been found to play an essential role in regulating terminal differentiation in ''Dictyostelium''. The yelA- mutant aggregates and develops normally until the mound stage, but does not proceed to form fingers or migrating slugs. Over the following 10 to 20 hours the mounds accumulate a bright yellow pigment typical for the sorus at the top of the fruiting body ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). Detergent resistant spores are formed ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]) after only 16 hours of development, at least 4 hours earlier than in wild-type populations.The N-terminal sequence of the predicted yelA protein shows significant similarity to domains found in the eIF-4G subunits of the translational initiation complex eIF-4F. In wild-type development the ''yelA'' mRNA acccumulates after 8 hours and is maintained in both prespore and prestalk cells until culmination, after which it is found in stalk cells only. YelA mutations can partially supress the block to sporulation in the prestalk gene mutants [/gene/DDB_G0293002 tagA] and [/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB]. These experiments suggest that yelA inhibits premature encapsulation until a signal from prestalk cells is received.

DDB_G0277853	Pascale Gaudet	The ''ecmA'' gene encodes an extracellular matrix protein that is a structural component of the stalk tube ([/ontology/go/0005201/annotation/page/1 extracellular matrix structural constituent]), ([/ontology/go/0030198/annotation/page/1 extracellular matrix organization and biogenesis]), ([/ontology/go/0005578/annotation/page/1 proteinaceous extracellular matrix]). ''ecmA'', [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], and [/gene/DDB_G0294473 staA] were isolated as prestalk-specific, DIF-inducible genes. Disruption of the ''ecmA'' gene results in long, tall standing slugs. Development progresses to yield normal fruiting bodies. ''ecmA'' null cells have morphologically normal slime sheath, but relatively weak slime trail [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8200481 (Morrison et al. 1994)]. <br />Differential expression of ''ecmA'' and ''ecmB'' in the anterior zone has led to the identification of several different prestalk cell types: the pstA cells, located at the anterior-most region of the prestalk zone and characterized by high expression of the ''ecmA'' gene directed by the proximal part of its promoter (''ecmA'' promoter), the pstAB cells, forming a cone-shaped area of the prestalk zone that occupies a core among the pstA region in which cells express both the ''ecmA'' and ''ecmB'' genes, and the pstO cells, located posterior to the pstA zone and characterized by low expression of the ''ecmA'' gene directed by the distal part of its promoter (''ecmO'' promoter) (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8016318 Williams and Morrison] in 1994).

DDB_G0278723	Karen Kestin	The GDT (growth-development transition) family of proteins are related by their involvement in the progression into developmentand by their sequence similarity. All members contain a putative transmembrane domain ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]), and with the exception of [/gene/DDB_G0285895 gdt5] and [/gene/DDB_G0292314 gdt7], contain a putative protein kinase domain ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) that is similar to the MLK (mixed-lineagekinase) family. Both [/gene/DDB_G0278723 gdt1] and [/gene/DDB_G0270666 gdt2] have been previously characterized, however, [/gene/DDB_G0278723 gdt1] lacks a conserved catalytic residue and therefore may not function as a kinase. Similarly, the [/gene/DDB_G0270544 gdt6]protein lacks this essential residue found in [/gene/DDB_G0270666 gdt2], [/gene/DDB_G0285891 gdt3], [/gene/DDB_G0270550 gdt4], and [/gene/DDB_G0270668 gdt8] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236669 Chibalina et al. 2004]).<br />The ''gdt1'' gene was identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10793140 Zeng et al. (2000)] in a screen for mutantsdefective in discoidin ([/gene/DDB_G0273063 dscA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273065 dscC-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273067 dscD-1]) production. The ''gdt1'' transcript is found in growing cells, however, it rapidly disappears atthe onset of development. Disruption of the ''gdt1'' locus results in constitutively expressed discoidin at high levels and premature aggregation incomparison to wild-type, in which discoidin expression coincides with the transition between growth and development. This suggests that Gdt1 functions in the repression of discoidin during the growth phase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10793140 Zeng et al. 2000]).<br />Null mutants of both [/gene/DDB_G0276267 gpaB] (G protein alpha 2) and [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC] (protein kinase A) exhibit an absence ofdiscoidin expression and fail to aggregate in response to starvation. Double mutants ''gdt1-/gpaB-'' and ''gdt1-/pkaC-''are also defective in aggregation, however, these mutants express discoidin at an elevated level, similar to ''gdt1'' null cells([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10793140 Zeng et al. 2000], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11270120 Zeng et al.2001]).

DDB_G0280495	Petra Fey	Fumarate hydratase is an enzyme of the [/ontology/go/0006099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] that hydrates fumarate into malate ([/ontology/go/0004333/annotation/page/1 fumarate hydratase activity]). The holoenzyme consists of a homotetramer. While bacteria have 3 different fumarases there is one in ''Dictyostelium'' and animals, which belong to the class-II fumarase family and are found in the [/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion] and in the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]. In rat it has been shown that the mitochondrial and cytosolic fumarases are synthesized from the same mRNA by alternative translational initiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1633825  (Suzuki et al., 1992)]. ESTs support that there are two isoforms in ''Dictyostelium''. The longer isoform contains a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence that is absent in the cytosolic isoform, which is 19 amino acids shorter at the N-terminus.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-FEB-2005 PF
DDB_G0280111	Karen Kestin	Members of the NAK (Numb-associated kinase) family of serine/threonine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) have been shown toparticipate in diverse cellular processes. The first characterized NAK was the ''Drosophila melanogaster'' NAK,named for its ability to interact with the neuronal differentiation protein Numb, hence the name NAK ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9418906 Chien et al. 1998]). Additional members of this family include AAK1 (AP2-associatedkinase), involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11877461 Conner and Schmid 2000]),and BIKe (BMP-induced kinase), which plays a role in bone differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500515 Kearns et al. 2001]). [/gene/DDB_G0276461 DDB_G0276461] and DDB0229350 are similar to the kinasedomains of AAK1 and BIKe. The NAK family also includes MPSK (myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threoninekinase), which is fatty acid acylated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10364453 Berson et al. 1999]) andmay play a role in TGF-beta signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947953 Ohta et al. 2000]).

DDB_G0280353	Petra Fey	The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>. It contains multiple copies of 3 enzymatic components: E1, E2, and E3. E1 ([/gene/DDB_G0280353 odhA]) has 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (). Multiple copies of E1 are bound to a core of dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2), which also binds multiple copies of lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). The lipoyl group of E2 ([/gene/DDB_G0275029 odhB]) is reductively succinylated by E1, and then passes this succinyl group to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/4149/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase activity]).<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes.

DDB_G0281863	Karen Kestin	The Slob (Slowpoke-binding protein) family of protein kinases ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) was originally identified in ''Drosophilamelanogaster'' as a binding partner with Slowpoke, a calcium-dependent potassium channel protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10230800 Zhou etal. 1999], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15234468 Zeng et al. 2004]). Similar proteins have alsobeen identified in mammals; these contain PX (phox) domains involved in intracellular signaling. Two putative Slobfamily sequences exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' proteome. [/gene/DDB_G0281863 slob1] contains an FYVE domain (namedfor the proteins in which it has been found: Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1), which is involved in zinc ion binding ([/ontology/go/0008270/annotation/page/1 zinc ion binding]), and a WH2 domain, which has been shown to interact with actin.

DDB_G0280545	Pascale Gaudet	There are 29 genes encoding actin in ''Dictyostelium'' with amino acid identity greater than 83%, ''act1''-''act29''.

The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0283265	Petra Fey	''mkkA'' was identified in a PCR screen for MEK kinases, and found to be a single developmentally regulated transcript, not detectable in vegetative cells and induced during early development. The MEKK&amp;alpha; protein contains a conserved F-box, known for its role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, followed by 5 WD40 repeats. Compared to wild-type, ''mkkA''-null cells developed more rapidly and formed fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0030587/annotation/page/1 sorocarp development]) with longer stalks and smaller sori ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). In the slug stage the null mutant shows an increase in the pstO compartment and a concomitant reduction in the prespore domain. Cells expressing a dominant-negative MEKK&amp;alpha; containing a L199A mutation in the putative ATP binding site had a similar but stronger morphological phenotype. In contrast, cells overexpressing MEKK&amp;alpha; or MEKK&amp;alpha;&amp;Delta;WD (lacking the WD40 repeats) showed very delayed development, which often arrested at the mound stage. Cells overexpressing only the F-box/WD40 repeats had a similar but more severe phenotype. Aberrant fruiting body formation and reduced spore production in these mutants suggest that MEKK&amp;alpha; plays an important role in prespore cell differentiation. <br />The Wd40 repeats were shown to target MEKK&amp;alpha; to the cortex ([/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex]). Two-hybrid screens using the F-box/WD40 repeats as bait identified two proteins of the ubiqination/deubiquination pathway, [/gene/DDB_G0275021 ubpB], a ubiquitin hydrolase, and [/gene/DDB_G0284865 ubcB], a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. ''ubpB'' and ''ubcB'' were shown to differentially control MEKK&amp;alpha; through the F-box/WD40 repeats in a cell-type specific and temporally regulated manner [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9832508  (Chung et al., 1998)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-OCT-2004 PF

DDB_G0279797	Pascale Gaudet	[/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA], a cell-counting factor in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', is considered to limit the maximum size of the multicellular structure, because a countin null strain forms a huge fruiting body compared to that of the wild-type ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). ''countin2'' is highly homologous to countin, sharing 40% identity in amino acid sequence. The countin2 null strain forms a higher number of aggregates, resulting in smaller fruiting bodies compared with those of wild-type cells. Thus, the Countin2 protein is thought to limit the minimum size of the multicellular structure. The size and number of aggregates formed by a mixture of countin null and countin2 null strains were the same as those of the wild-type. These findings demonstrate that a combination of Countin and Countin2 proteins determines the appropriate size of the multicellular structure [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11737154 (Okuwa et al.2001)]Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-OCT-2003 PG

All APs are comprised of two large subunits, one medium size subunit, and one small subunit. ''Dictyostelium'' gamma-adaptin encodes a large subunit (100 kD), which shares 44% identity with the human gamma1-adaptin. Cell fractionation indicated that gamma-adaptin associates with other subunits to form a ''bona fide'' AP-1 complex, further strengthened by th co-immunoprecipitation with mu1 ([/gene/DDB_G0289247 apm1]).

This mitochondrial enzyme contains 3 catalytic components, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a heterotetrameric alpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0286335 bkdA]), beta2 ([/gene/DDB_G0268020 bkdB]) enzyme, with 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase activity ().<br /> E2 is a homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyl transacylase ([/gene/DDB_G0281797 bkdC]) that forms the core of the multienzyme and binds to both E1 and E3 ([/ontology/go/5515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]). The lipoyl group of E2 is reductively 2-methylpropanoylated by E1, and then passes this 2-methylpropanoyl to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/8415/annotation/page/1 acyltransferase activity]). In addition to the 2-methylpropanoyl group, formed when E1 acts on the oxoacid that corresponds with valine, this enzyme also transfers the 3-methylbutanoyl and S-2-methylbutanoyl groups when E1 acts on the oxoacids corresponding with leucine and isoleucine, respectively.<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes.

DDB_G0285211	Karen Kestin	The [/gene/DDB_G0285211 fadA] gene was originally identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10504413 Saito and Ochiai (1999)] in a search for ESTs containing the conserved histidine-box domain found in proteins capable of [/ontology/go/0006636/annotation/page/1 unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic process]. Overexpression of the FadA protein and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that thisprotein is specific for desaturation of the 5 position of C16 and C18 fatty acids. A second desaturase,[/gene/DDB_G0282147 fadB], was later identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10712614 Saito and colleagues (2000)].Similar experiments with the FadB protein show a specificity for the 5 position in C18 fatty acids.<br />Null mutants of ''fadB'' show no detectable phenotype, whereas ''fadA-'' cells have an increased toleranceto heat shock ([/ontology/go/0009408/annotation/page/1 response to heat]). This is indicative of the importance of membrane fluidity, which is regulated byfatty acid modification of desaturases such as FadA and FadB ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15632431 Saito et al.2005]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-JAN-2005 KP
DDB_G0287913	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' OatA belongs to the class III aminotransferases that bind, like all aminotransferases pyridoxal phosphate ([/ontology/go/30170/annotation/page/1 pyridoxal phosphate binding]). One subgroup is ornithine aminotransferase, ([/ontology/go/4587/annotation/page/1 ornithine-oxo-acid transaminase activity]; EC: 2.6.1.13), which catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from ornithine to alpha-ketoglutarate, yielding glutamic-5-semi-aldehyde and glutamic acid.

DDB_G0287587	Pascale Gaudet	Starved Dictyostelium cells aggregate into groups of roughly 10(5) cells. Cells in which the ''smlA'' gene is disrupted form small aggregates ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). The ''smlA'' mRNA is expressed in vegetative and early developing cells, and decreases at about 10 hours of development. The sequence of the cDNA and the derived amino acid sequence of the SmlA protein show no significant similarity to any known sequence. Immunofluorescence and staining of Western blots of cell fractions indicates that SmlA is a 35x10(3) Mr cytosolic protein ([/ontology/go/0005829/annotation/page/1 cytosol]) present in all vegetative and developing cells and is absent from ''smlA''- cells. The absence of SmlA does not affect the growth rate, cell cycle, differentiation, or developmental speed of cells. Synergy experiments indicate that mixing 5% smlA cells with wild-type cells will cause the wild-type cells to form smaller fruiting bodies and aggregates. SmlA appears to regulate the secretion or processing of a secreted factor that regulates aggregate size, counting factor (CF) ([/ontology/go/0009306/annotation/page/1 protein secretion]), ([/ontology/go/0007165/annotation/page/1 signal transduction]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8787732 (Brock et al.1996)]. Compared with wild-type or [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA]countin cells, ''smlA''- cells have large cAMP pulses and small cGMP pulses [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11371560 (Tang et al.2001)]. ''smlA'' null cells have decreased adhesion, increased motility, increased amounts of polymerized actin and the ABP-120 actin-crosslinking protein, as well as increased phosphorylation and redistribution of myosin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090633 Roisin-Bouffay et al.2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11818526 Tang et al.2002]).

DDB_G0286191	Petra Fey	The ''atg8'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495  (Otto et al., 2003)]. Macroautophagy ([/ontology/go/0016236/annotation/page/1 macroautophagy]) is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. In ''atg8''-null cells, survival during nitrogen starvation ([/ontology/go/0006995/annotation/page/1 cellular response to nitrogen starvation]) is reduced. Upon starvation mutant cells show little turnover of cellular components. Development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) of the mutant is slightly impaired. On bacterial lawns cells aggregate mainly in the center of plaques and not in the periphery, and multi-tipped aggregates form very small fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). Axenically grown cells plated on filters form multi-tipped aggregates that develop into small but normal looking fruiting bodies. These fruiting bodies produce few viable, detergent-resistent spores ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]). Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the atg8 mutation is autonomous. The phenotype of the ''atg8''-null mutant is almost identical to that of the [/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A]-null mutant. Both mutants have the mildest defects when compared to [/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1], [/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5], and [/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7] mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736886  (Otto et al., 2004)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-SEP-2004 PF

GBF is highly basic and contains two putative zinc fingers. However, ''in vivo'' GBF function requires only one intact zinc finger[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11397018 (Brown and Firtel 2001)]. Upon starvation, GBF is activated by high cAMP concentration via a G-protein-independent pathway involving [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1], the high-affinity cAMP receptor that regulates aggregation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7774015 (Schnitzler et al. 1995)]. <br />G boxes are found in the promoters of several postaggregative and cell-type-specific genes, including [/gene/DDB_G0277829 carC], [/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB], [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC], [/gene/DDB_G0290957 cprA], [/gene/DDB_G0279799 cprB], and [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB]([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1321061 Ceccarelli et al. 1992], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2897942 Datta and Firtel 1988], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8482418 Fosnaugh and Loomis 1993], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9126295 Gollop and Kimmel 1997],[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2163344 Haberstroh and Firtel 1990], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1668278 Haberstroh et al. 1991], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2545528 Hjorth et al. 1989], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2159939 1990], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2843819 Pears and Williams 1988], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8065317 Powell-Coffman et al. 1994]).Consistent with these data, analysis of the ''gbfA''-null cell line provided additional evidence that GBF is a key component of the development switch between aggregation and multicellular differentiation as a general inducer of postaggregative and cell-type-specific gene expression ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). The ''gbfA''-null cells aggregate and express pulse-induced genes normally, but as cells reach the loose mound stage, the postaggregative signaling machinery is not induced, and subsequent morphogenesis is not initiated (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10611970 Aubry and Firtel] in 1999).

The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0291916	Petra Fey	''argJ'' is the ''Dictyostelium'' member of the ArgJ family that catalyzes the first and fifth steps in [/ontology/go/0006526/annotation/page/1 arginine biosynthetic process]. These are evolutionarily related enzymes found in bacteria, yeast, fungi, and plants. Some but not all appear bifunctional, catalyzing the synthesis of acetlyglutamate from glutamate and acetyl-CoA ([/ontology/go/0004358/annotation/page/1 glutamate N-acetyltransferase activity]), and of ornithine by transacetylation between acetylornithine and glutamate ([/ontology/go/0006592/annotation/page/1 ornithine biosynthetic process]). The yeast enzyme, ARG7, which has been shown to be bifunctional [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9428669  (Crabeel et al., 1997)], is 41% identical to the ''Dictyostelium'' protein.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-FEB-2005 PF
DDB_G0291752	Karen Kestin	Members of the structural maintentance of chromosomes (SMC) family are involved in manybiological processes, including sister chromatid cohesion ([/ontology/go/0007064/annotation/page/1 mitotic sister chromatid cohesion]), chromosome condensation([/ontology/go/0007076/annotation/page/1 mitotic chromosome condensation]), and DNA repair ([/ontology/go/0006281/annotation/page/1 DNA repair]). In ''Dictyostelium'', as in all eukaryotes, six members of thisconserved family exist: [/gene/DDB_G0291752 smc1], [/gene/DDB_G0284499 smc2], [/gene/DDB_G0276101 smc3], [/gene/DDB_G0286403 smc4], [/gene/DDB_G0290919 smc5], and [/gene/DDB_G0288993 smc6]. These proteins contain globulardomains at either end, separated by a hinge domain. The SMC proteins are capable of formingthree different types of heterodimers: Smc1-Smc3, Smc2-Smc4, and Smc5-Smc6 (reviewed in[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12360193 Jessberger 2002]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-DEC-2004 KP
DDB_G0289329	Pascale Gaudet	Differentiation-inducing factor (DIF)-1 is a chlorinated alkyl phenone released by developing ''Dictyostelium'' cells and that can induce stalk cell differentiation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/183142 (Town et al. 1976)]. The last step in DIF-1 synthesis, the methylation of des-methyl-DIF-1 to form DIF-1, is catalyzed by the product of the ''dmtA'' gene, des-methyl-DIF-1 methyltransferase ([/ontology/go/0008171/annotation/page/1 O-methyltransferase activity]), ([/ontology/go/0008757/annotation/page/1 S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity]). The ''dmtA'' mRNA is developmentally regulated, peaking at the first-finger/slug stage in parallel with DIF-1 and methyltransferase enzyme activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11163223 Thompson and Kay 2000], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9446571 Kay 1998]). <br />''dmtA'' null mutants can form slugs that are able to produce one prestalk cell type, the pstA cells, and can form mature stalk cells. However, the other major prestalk cell type, the pstO cells, is missing ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]). Differentiation defects are restored by development on a uniform concentration of DIF-1. It therefore appears that pstO and pstA cells are induced by separate signals and that DIF-1 is the pstO inducer [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11163223 (Thompson and Kay 2000)]. DIF-1 biosynthesis occurs mostly in prespore cells. These results support a model in which prespore cells cross-induce the differentiation of pstO cells by making DIF-1, and that this is one of the regulatory loops that sets the proportion of prespore-to-prestalk cells in the aggregate [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11748133 (Kay and Thompson 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PG
DDB_G0291350	Karen Kestin	Members of the NAK (Numb-associated kinase) family of serine/threonine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) have been shown toparticipate in diverse cellular processes. The first characterized NAK was the ''Drosophila melanogaster'' NAK,named for its ability to interact with the neuronal differentiation protein Numb, hence the name NAK ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9418906 Chien et al. 1998]). Additional members of this family include AAK1 (AP2-associatedkinase), involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11877461 Conner and Schmid 2000]),and BIKe (BMP-induced kinase), which plays a role in bone differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500515 Kearns et al. 2001]). [/gene/DDB_G0276461 DDB_G0276461] and [/gene/DDB_G0280111 DDB_G0280111] are similar to the kinasedomains of AAK1 and BIKe. The NAK family also includes MPSK (myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threoninekinase), which is fatty acid acylated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10364453 Berson et al. 1999]) andmay play a role in TGF-beta signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947953 Ohta et al. 2000]).

DDB_G0289395	Karen Kestin	In a search for novel receptors similar to the cAR (cAMP receptor) proteins ([/ontology/go/0001646/annotation/page/1 cAMP receptor activity]), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14732403 Raisley et al.

All three of the Crl proteins are predicted to contain aseven transmembrane domain characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]).<br />The ''crlB'' transcript is found only in post-aggregative cells and peaks after 16 h of starvation. The ''crlB-'' mutant has no detectable phenotype [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14732403 (Raisley et al. 2004)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-MAR-2004 KP
DDB_G0291133	Karen Kestin	The wee1 family of tyrosine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004713/annotation/page/1 protein-tyrosine kinase activity]) were originally identified in a screen formutants that undergo mitosis at a reduced cell size in the fission yeast ''Schizosaccharomycespombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7262540 Nurse and Thuriaux 1980]). Since then, members ofthe wee1 family have been shown to play an essential role in cell cycle regulation ([/ontology/go/0000074/annotation/page/1 regulation of progression through cell cycle]) in several other organisms, including thebudding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', the African clawed frog ''Xenopus laevis'', andseveral metazoans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Wee1 phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue on the mitosis promoting protein Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 ([/gene/DDB_G0272813 cdk1] in ''Dictyostelium''). Phosphorylation of this residue by Wee1 inhibits Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28,thereby delaying entry into mitosis from G2. Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 is inactivated by dephosphorylation of thetyrosine residue by the phosphatase Cdc25/Mih1 ([/gene/DDB_G0283617 cdc25] in ''Dictyostelium''), allowingentry into mitosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Three uncharacterized putative wee1 family members exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0291842 DDB_G0291842], [/gene/DDB_G0277539 DDB_G0277539], and [/gene/DDB_G0291133 DDB_G0291133].

DDB_G0291982	Pascale Gaudet	The psi factor (prespore-inducing factor) is a secreted factor ([/ontology/go/0005576/annotation/page/1 extracellular region]) that has the ability to induce prespore cell differentiation under appropriate conditions. The psi factor has been purified and characterized. It is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 106 kDa. The predicted molecular mass of the mature secreted protein is 60 kDa. The ''psiA'' gene is maximally expressed at the loose mound stage. Knockout mutant strains develop normally. However, conditioned medium from these mutants shows reduced prespore-cell-inducing activity and reduced prespore cell division-inducing activity. This data suggests that the PsiA plays a role in [/ontology/go/0045597/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of cell differentiation]. Due to its lack of sequence similarity with characterized proteins, the Psi factor has been proposed to be a novel type of growth factor that does not belong to any of the families of growth factor so far identified in animals ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367206 Kawata et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-SEP-2004 PG
DDB_G0289247	Petra Fey	In search for ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin adaptor complexes (APs) cDNAs ''apm1'', [/gene/DDB_G0277901 apm3], and [/gene/DDB_G0276945 apm4], encoding proteins homologous to mammalian medium chain (mu) subunits, have been cloned. All APs are comprised of two large subunits, one medium size subunit, and one small subunit. ''Apm1'' encodes the medium chain of AP-1 ([/ontology/go/0030121/annotation/page/1 AP-1 adaptor complex]), which is known to be associated with clathrin coated vesicles from the trans-Golgi network ([/ontology/go/0030130/annotation/page/1 clathrin coat of trans-Golgi network vesicle]). The ''apm1'' encoded protein (mu1) shares 69% identity with the mouse mu1A, and is very similar in size (49 kD). This, and the presence of conserved residues potentially interacting with tyrosine-based sorting signals indicates that ''apm1'' truly encodes an AP-1 medium chain. Expression levels of ''apm1'' remain constant throughout development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11179674  (de Chassey et al., 2001)].<br />Deletion of ''apm1'' causes defects in growth and spore germination, and a delay in development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). Two lysosomal enzymes are secreted as precursors, indicating that lysosomal transport ([/ontology/go/0007041/annotation/page/1 lysosomal transport]) is impaired. Investigation of the endosome membrane marker [/gene/DDB_G0287297 p80] in apm1- cells showed the correct localization, but the size of endosomes appeared smaller and their number was significantly increased compaired to wild-type ([/ontology/go/0007032/annotation/page/1 endosome organization and biogenesis]). This result was confirmed by electron microscopy. Amp1- cells also failed to adjust to hypotonic stress ([/ontology/go/0006971/annotation/page/1 hypotonic response]), and while two markers for the contractile vacuole failed to localize correctly, no contractile vacuole could be identified by electron microscopy. Together with the studies of the AP-1 large subunit [/gene/DDB_G0281957 ap1g1] these data elucidate the functions of the AP-1 vesicular coat protein [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12802059  (Lefkir et al., 2003)].

Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase II is composed of 12 subunits: [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1], [/gene/DDB_G0288257 rpb2], [/gene/DDB_G0292244 rpb3], [/gene/DDB_G0282739 rpb4], [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0284891 rpb7], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0268306 rpb9], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], [/gene/DDB_G0277677 rpb11], and[/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12]. Subunits 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are common to all threeRNA polymerases (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). <br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-APR-2004 PG
DDB_G0289881	Petra Fey	The ''atg5'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man. Macroautophagy ([/ontology/go/0016236/annotation/page/1 macroautophagy]) is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. atg5-null mutants grow normally, but survival during nitrogen starvation ([/ontology/go/0006995/annotation/page/1 cellular response to nitrogen starvation]) is reduced. Upon starvation mutant cells also show little turnover of cellular components. Development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) of the mutant is severely impaired. On bacterial lawns mutant cells do not aggregate, and axenically grown cells plated on filters form abberant fruiting bodies. These fruiting bodies produce no viable, detergent-resistent spores ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]). Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the atg5 mutation is autonomous. The mutant phenotype of atg5-null is almost identical to the [/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7]-null phenotype. Another autophagy protein, [/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8], shows a change in localization when compared in wild-type and atg5-null cells. Experiments with GFP-labelled autophagy proteins indicate that the atg5-[/gene/DDB_G0282929 atg12] conjugation system that has been described in yeast, is conserved in ''Dictyostelium'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495  (Otto et al., 2003)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF
DDB_G0289319	Pascale Gaudet	Members of the Myb family of transcription factors are typically composed of two orthree imperfect repeats each of about 50 amino acids.

DDB_G0289325	Petra Fey	 Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is an enzyme in the [/ontology/go/0006099/annotation/page/1 tricarboxylic acid cycle] that catalyzes the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with the concomitant hydrolysis of NTP to NDP and phosphate. There are two forms of the enzyme, using either ATP or GTP. The [/gene/DDB_G0289325 scsA] gene encodes the succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit. In eukaryotes one alpha and one beta subunit are thought to form a heterodimer. Anschutzt ''et al.'' determined that in crude [/ontology/go/0016020/annotation/page/1 membrane] extracts ScsA could be phosphorylated by ATP and GTP, but the purified enzyme showed high specificity for GTP ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8448193  Anschutz et al., 1993]). <br />Only one alpha subunit has been identified in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7771809  Birney and Klein, 1995]). However, two beta subunits are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome; [/gene/DDB_G0274449 scsB] is the ortholog of GDP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits () and [/gene/DDB_G0271842 scsC] is highly similar to known ADP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunits ().Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-JAN-2005 PF
DDB_G0291081	Karen Kestin	The [/gene/DDB_G0291081 pefA] and [/gene/DDB_G0293530 pefB] genes were identified as homologs of mammalian ALG-2 (<u>a</u>poptosis-<u>l</u>inked <u>g</u>ene 2), which is involved in programmed cell death, as its name suggests. The pefA and pefB proteins eachcontain five calcium-binding ([/ontology/go/0005509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding]) EF hand motifs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al.2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al. 2002]).<br />Expression of ''pefA'' mRNA is developmentally regulated, however, two separate Northern blot experiments show differentpatterns of expression. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037  Ohkouchi and colleagues (2001)] show that ''pefA'' expressionis low during growth and gradually increases through the developmental program, whereas [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al.(2002)] report a peak in ''pefA'' expression at 4 hours followed by a rapid decline. PefA has been shown tolocalize intracellularly to the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]) and, in the presence of calcium, to the membrane fraction ([/ontology/go/0005624/annotation/page/1 membrane fraction]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al.2002]). Additionally, in situ hybridization analysis of ''pefA'' shows expression in the posterior presporeregion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001]).<br />In surface plasmon resonance experiments, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry and colleagues (2002)] demonstrate thatPefA is capable of dimerizing with itself ([/ontology/go/0042803/annotation/page/1 protein homodimerization activity]), PefB ([/ontology/go/0046982/annotation/page/1 protein heterodimerization activity]), and with murine Alix (ALG-2 interacting protein X, homolog of ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0275451 alxA]). PefB, on the other hand, heterodimerizes ([/ontology/go/0046982/annotation/page/1 protein heterodimerization activity]) with PefA but fails to dimerize with murineAlix. Additionally, they show that null mutants of both '' pefA'' and ''pefB'' and double mutants ''pefA-''/''pefB-'' have no detectable developmental phenotype.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-SEP-2004 KP

The E3 enzyme [/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd] is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/0004148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes and the glycine cleavage system. In addition, the pyruvatedehydrogenase complex contains component X ([/gene/DDB_G0271564 pdhX]) that binds E3 ([/ontology/go/0005515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]) and has an apparent structural rolein the complex (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9399911 Aral et al. 1997]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-DEC-2004 KP
DDB_G0292998	Pascale Gaudet	''rasB'' encodes a Ras subfamily protein ([/ontology/go/0005525/annotation/page/1 GTP binding]), ([/ontology/go/0003924/annotation/page/1 GTPase activity]). Northern blot analysis has shown that ''rasB'' expression is developmentally regulated with maximum levels of a single 950-bp message detected during vegetative growth and the first 8 h of development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8455930 Daniel et al. 1993]). The RasB protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus ([/ontology/go/0016363/annotation/page/1 nuclear matrix]) during most of the cell cycle. Furthermore, during mitosis and cytokinesis RasB assumes a diffuse [/ontology/go/0005622/annotation/page/1 intracellular] localization. ''rasB''- cells exhibit severe growth defects. Cells overexpressing an activated version of RasB in a [/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG] null background are multinucleate, a sign of defective [/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11606416 (Sutherland et al. 2001)], have severely impaired growth ([/ontology/go/0042127/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell proliferation]) and enhanced [/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motility] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725225 Khosla et al. 2000]). <br />RasB interacts with [/gene/DDB_G0289555 arkA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14597204 Aubry et al. 2003]).

DDB_G0292354	Karen Kestin	Members of the casein kinase I (CK1) family ([/ontology/go/0004681/annotation/page/1 casein kinase I activity]) of serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in manycellular processes. Casein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate the 14-3-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) protein inmammals, play a role in Wnt signaling in ''Xenopus laevis'' and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', and maintaincircadian rhythms in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. Additionally, CK1 plays a role in DNA repair ([/ontology/go/0006281/annotation/page/1 DNA repair])in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).<br />Two casein kinase I family members have been identified in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', [/gene/DDB_G0273059 cak1] and''DDB0216336''. Cak1 is highly similar to CK1s in yeast and in metazoans. DDB0216336 is a putative casein kinase Ithat is highly similar to the CK1 subfamily tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12471243 Manning etal. 2002]). The Cak1 protein has been shown to phosphorylate casein when it is expressed in ''E.coli'' cells, and localizes to both the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]) and the nucleus ([/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]) inimmunofluorescence assays. Null mutations and overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Cak1 fail to produce viable cells, indicating that this protein may be essential for growth. Overexpression of wild-type Cak1 results in decreased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea; this suggests a role for Cak1 in DNA repair ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-MAY-2004 KP

DDB_G0293900	Pascale Gaudet	Members of the Myb family of transcription factors are typically composed of two orthree imperfect repeats each of about 50 amino acids. These repeats fold into a variant ofthe helix-turn-helix motif and bind DNA. The Myb motif has been well conserved during evolution (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999] and references therein).<br />The putative DNA-binding domain of ''Dictyostelium mybA'' is as closely related to vertebrate c-Myb as is ''Drosophila'' Myb (65% identity), whereas the known Myb-related proteins of plants and yeast are more distantly related. The conserved domain of ''Dictyostelium'' MybA is capable of binding to the same DNA sequence as the vertebrate and ''Drosophila'' Myb proteins. The remainder of the deduced amino acid sequence of ''Dictyostelium'' MybA shows no homology to the divergent domains of the known animal, plant and yeast Myb-related proteins. Evolutionary analysis implies that the duplications that generated the repeats of the Myb DNA-binding domain began prior to the divergence of animals, plants, cellular slime molds and yeast [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1549373 (Stober-Grasser et al. 1992)]<br />In electrophoretic shift assays, MybA binds specifically to a sequence from the [/gene/DDB_G0269112 celB] promoter containing the Myb consensus binding site TAACTGA ([/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding]). Mutation of Myb binding sites of the [/gene/DDB_G0271134 celA] and [/gene/DDB_G0269112 celB] promoters results in aberrant expression of these genes ([/ontology/go/0000122/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter])([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7659526 Ramalingam and Ennis 1995], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7659526 Ramalingam and Ennis 1995]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-MAY-2004 PG

''cshA'' null cells display aberrant developmental morphology on bacterial lawns, but development is normal on buffered agar. ''cshA'' disruption results in a 50% reduction in enzyme activity. The remaining activity could be due to the citrate synthase encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0276965 gltA] or the [/gene/DDB_G0287281 DDB_G0287281] genes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15225305 Huang et al. 2004]).

DDB_G0287733	Karen Kestin	First identified by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10978342 Bogdanovic and colleagues (2000)], [/gene/DDB_G0287733 syn7A]is a homolog of human syntaxin 7 and localizes to the [/ontology/go/0005768/annotation/page/1 endosome]. Syn7A interacts with the highly conserved[/gene/DDB_G0276153 nsfA] (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) known to play a role in vesicle trafficking. In an experiment designed to find proteins that interact with Syn7A, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12175335 Bogdanovic etal. (2002)] identified [/gene/DDB_G0292974 vti1A], [/gene/DDB_G0275429 syn8A], and [/gene/DDB_G0284951 vamp7A]. Allof these proteins are members of the SNARE family (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein REceptor) and likely functiontogether to mediate [/ontology/go/0006906/annotation/page/1 vesicle fusion].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 06-APR-2005 KP
DDB_G0286015	Pascale Gaudet	''gmsA'' was isolated as one of 67 gamete-enriched genes in expression analysis experiments based on real-time RT-PCR. RNAi-mediated silencing as well as disruption of ''gmsA'' reduced the cellular competency for sexual cell fusion, indicating the involvement of this gene in the sexual development of ''D. discoideum'' ([/ontology/go/0000747/annotation/page/1 conjugation with cellular fusion]). In addition to the hydroxyproline-rich region homologous to the a2 gene from ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'', ''gmsA'' also contains sequences for the SCP family of extracellular domain (SMART accession # SM0198)([/ontology/go/0009897/annotation/page/1 external side of plasma membrane]) in the 5' region, and the Papain family cysteine protease domain (pfam accession # PF00112)([/ontology/go/0008234/annotation/page/1 cysteine-type peptidase activity]) in the 3' region. The mechanism for ''gmsA'' involvement in cell fusion is currently unknown. Considering that the ''gmsA'' gene contains a possible signal sequence for plasma membrane and an extracellular domain, its product is expected to localize on the cell surface and mediate the recognition between gametes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12963116 (Muramoto et al. 2003)]. Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-OCT-2003 PG
DDB_G0287795	Karen Kestin	The glycine cleavage system complex consists of four proteins that function to catalyze the net reaction glycine + THFA &lt;=&gt; NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + 5,10-methylene THFA.The glycine cleavage complex contains a P-protein ([/gene/DDB_G0287255 gcvP], a glycine dehydrogenase ()), and an aminomethyltransferase ([/ontology/go/0004047/annotation/page/1 aminomethyltransferase activity]) T-protein ([/gene/DDB_G0292326 gcvT]). Interestingly, the ''Dicytostelium'' proteome includes five putative methylamine carrier H-proteins ([/gene/DDB_G0287773 gcvH1], [/gene/DDB_G0290845 gcvH2], [/gene/DDB_G0287791 gcvH3], [/gene/DDB_G0287795 gcvH4], and [/gene/DDB_G0287861 gcvH5]), whereas other species contain only one H-protein. The final component of the glycine cleavage system is [/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd], a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/0004148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is a member of several other dehydrogenase complexes, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1993704 Kume et al. 1991]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-JAN-2005 KP
DDB_G0286335	Petra Fey	The oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine), is catalyzed by the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This mitochondrial enzyme contains 3 catalytic components, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a heterotetrameric alpha2 ([/gene/DDB_G0286335 bkdA]), beta2 ([/gene/DDB_G0268020 bkdB]) enzyme, with 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase activity ().<br /> E2 is a homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyl transacylase ([/gene/DDB_G0281797 bkdC]) that forms the core of the multienzyme and binds to both E1 and E3 ([/ontology/go/5515/annotation/page/1 protein binding]). The lipoyl group of E2 is reductively 2-methylpropanoylated by E1, and then passes this 2-methylpropanoyl to coenzyme A ([/ontology/go/8415/annotation/page/1 acyltransferase activity]). In addition to the 2-methylpropanoyl group, formed when E1 acts on the oxoacid that corresponds with valine, this enzyme also transfers the 3-methylbutanoyl and S-2-methylbutanoyl groups when E1 acts on the oxoacids corresponding with leucine and isoleucine, respectively.<br />The E3 enzyme ([/gene/DDB_G0291648 lpd]) is adihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ([/ontology/go/4148/annotation/page/1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity]) that is shared by three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes. These include the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the glycine cleavage system, and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-DEC-2004 PF
DDB_G0274129	Pascale Gaudet	There are 29 genes encoding actin in ''Dictyostelium'' with amino acid identity greater than 83%, ''act1''-''act29''. Seventeen of these genes encode identical proteins: [/gene/DDB_G0289553 act1], [/gene/DDB_G0274133 act2], [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8], [/gene/DDB_G0274601 act9], [/gene/DDB_G0288879 act11], [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12], [/gene/DDB_G0274599 act13], [/gene/DDB_G0274137 act14], [/gene/DDB_G0272520 act15], [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16], [/gene/DDB_G0274727 act19], [/gene/DDB_G0274285 act20], and [/gene/DDB_G0274561 act21], while [/gene/DDB_G0289811 act10], [/gene/DDB_G0275023 act22], and [/gene/DDB_G0289487 act3] respectively have 1, 4 and 11 amino acid differences compared to the 17 identical genes. The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PG
DDB_G0287291	Petra Fey	The ''abpD'' gene was identified in a search for novel members of the alpha-actinin superfamily. The interaptin protein has an approximate molecular weight of 200 kD and consists of three distinct domains: the N-terminal actin binding domain ([/ontology/go/0003779/annotation/page/1 actin binding]), a central coiled-coil rod domain, and a C-terminal membrane binding domain. It has been shown that interaptin associates with the nuclear envelope and the ER ([/ontology/go/0042175/annotation/page/1 nuclear envelope-endoplasmic reticulum network]) via the membrane binding domain. The ''abpD'' transcript and protein are developmentally and cAMP-regulated. In the abpD- mutant development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) is delayed and cell agglutination ([/ontology/go/0016337/annotation/page/1 cell-cell adhesion]) is slighly impaired [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9700162  (Rivero et al., 1998)]. When abpD-null cells were investigated on soil substrate (under conditions closer to natural ones), more severe developmental defects were found. The fruiting body size and shape is heterogenious and slugs have enlargements all over the slug body and release a high amount of slime sheath. Spore viability ([/ontology/go/0009847/annotation/page/1 spore germination]) was also shown to be severely reduced [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10704840  (Ponte et al., 2000)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF
DDB_G0271096	Petra Fey	The ''atg7'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man. Macroautophagy ([/ontology/go/0016236/annotation/page/1 macroautophagy]) is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. atg7-null mutants grow normally, but survival during nitrogen starvation ([/ontology/go/0006995/annotation/page/1 cellular response to nitrogen starvation]) is reduced. Upon starvation mutant cells also show little turnover of cellular components. Development ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) of the mutant is severely impaired. On bacterial lawns mutant cells do not aggregate, and axenically grown cells plated on filters form abberant fruiting bodies. These fruiting bodies produce no viable, detergent-resistent spores ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]). Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the atg5- mutation is autonomous. The mutant phenotype of atg7-null is almost identical to the [/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5]-null phenotype. Another autophagy protein, [/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8], shows a change in localization when compared in wild-type and atg7-null cells. In yeast, the E1-like atg7 protein has been shown to activate [/gene/DDB_G0282929 atg12] in an ubiquitination-like reaction ([/ontology/go/0008640/annotation/page/1 ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme activity]) before conjugation with atg5. This interaction was confirmed in ''Dictyostelium'' when the atg5-atg12 conjugate was found to be absent in atg7 mutants [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495  (Otto et al., 2003)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF
DDB_G0276461	Karen Kestin	Members of the NAK (Numb-associated kinase) family of serine/threonine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) have been shown toparticipate in diverse cellular processes. The first characterized NAK was the ''Drosophila melanogaster'' NAK,named for its ability to interact with the neuronal differentiation protein Numb, hence the name NAK ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9418906 Chien et al. 1998]). Additional members of this family include AAK1 (AP2-associatedkinase), involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11877461 Conner and Schmid 2000]),and BIKe (BMP-induced kinase), which plays a role in bone differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500515 Kearns et al. 2001]). DDB0229347 and [/gene/DDB_G0280111 DDB_G0280111] are similar to the kinasedomains of AAK1 and BIKe. The NAK family also includes MPSK (myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threoninekinase), which is fatty acid acylated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10364453 Berson et al. 1999]) andmay play a role in TGF-beta signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947953 Ohta et al. 2000]). The mostclosely related protein to MPSK in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' is [/gene/DDB_G0291350 DDB_G0291350].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2004 KP
DDB_G0277901	Petra Fey	In search for ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin adaptor complexes (APs) cDNAs ''apm3'', [/gene/DDB_G0289247 apm1], and [/gene/DDB_G0276945 apm4], encoding proteins homologous to mammalian medium chain (mu) subunits, have been cloned. All APs are comprised of two large subunits, one medium size subunit, and one small subunit. ''Apm3'' encodes the medium chain of AP-3 ([/ontology/go/0030123/annotation/page/1 AP-3 adaptor complex]), which is known to be associated with the trans-Golgi network ([/ontology/go/0005794/annotation/page/1 Golgi apparatus]) and endosomes ([/ontology/go/0005768/annotation/page/1 endosome]), and to mediate delivery of membrane proteins to lysosomes ([/ontology/go/0005764/annotation/page/1 lysosome]). The ''apm3'' protein (mu3) shares 51% identity with the human mu3A, and is very similar in size (47 kD). This, and the presence of conserved residues potentially interacting with tyrosine-based sorting signals indicates that ''apm3'' truly encodes an AP-3 medium chain. Expression levels of ''apm3'' remain constant throughout development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11179674  (de Chassey et al., 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF
DDB_G0270666	Karen Kestin	The GDT (growth-development transition) family of proteins are related by their involvement in the progression into developmentand by their sequence similarity. All members contain a putative transmembrane domain ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]), and with the exception of [/gene/DDB_G0285895 gdt5] and [/gene/DDB_G0292314 gdt7], contain a putative protein kinase domain ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) that is similar to the MLK (mixed-lineagekinase) family. Both [/gene/DDB_G0278723 gdt1] and [/gene/DDB_G0270666 gdt2] have been previously characterized, however, [/gene/DDB_G0278723 gdt1] lacks a conserved catalytic residue and therefore may not function as a kinase. Similarly, the [/gene/DDB_G0270544 gdt6]protein lacks this essential residue found in [/gene/DDB_G0270666 gdt2], [/gene/DDB_G0285891 gdt3], [/gene/DDB_G0270550 gdt4], and [/gene/DDB_G0270668 gdt8] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236669 Chibalina et al. 2004]).<br />In a search for mutants resistant to a phospholipase D (PLD) inhibitor, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236669 Chibalina et al.2004] identified ''gdt2''. Similar to the [/gene/DDB_G0278723 gdt1] mutant, ''gdt2'' null cells express high levels of discoidinand aggregate prematurely. However, unlike Gdt1, Gdt2 does not appear to be in the PKA pathway; treatment of ''gdt2-''cells with a PKA inhibitor represses discoidin expression, bypassing the discoidin overexpression phenotype. Also in contrastto ''gdt1'' is the ''gdt2'' expression profile: the ''gdt2'' transcript can be detected at constant levels at all stages of development([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236669 Chibalina et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0276767	Pascale Gaudet	Phospholipase B (PLB) catalyzes the degradation of phosphatidylcholine to glycerophosphocholine. [/ontology/go/0004622/annotation/page/1 lysophospholipase activity] has been detected in ''Dictyostelium'' in 1970 by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5528230 Ferber and colleagues]. The gene encoding this activity was described in 2004 by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15193148 Morgan et al.] PLB does not share any similarity with other known phospholipase B proteins. Remarkably, proteins with significant similarity to ''Dictyostelium'' PLB are found in mammals, ''C. elegans'', and ''Drosophila''. This gene therefore appear to make up a new gene family that have phospholipase B activity. In addition to phosphatidylcholine, PLB also hydrolyses phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, indicating that it plays roles in [/ontology/go/0009395/annotation/page/1 phospholipid catabolic process], [/ontology/go/0046338/annotation/page/1 phosphatidylethanolamine catabolic process], and [/ontology/go/0046488/annotation/page/1 phosphatidylinositol metabolic process].

DDB_G0269132	Pascale Gaudet	The ''ecmB'' gene encodes an extracellular matrix protein that is a structural component of the stalk tube([/ontology/go/0005201/annotation/page/1 extracellular matrix structural constituent]), ([/ontology/go/0030198/annotation/page/1 extracellular matrix organization and biogenesis]), ([/ontology/go/0005578/annotation/page/1 proteinaceous extracellular matrix]) . [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], ''ecmB'', and [/gene/DDB_G0294473 staA] were isolated as prestalk-specific, DIF-inducible genes. ''ecmB'' null cells undergo apparently normal development, suggesting a functional redundancy between [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA] and ''ecmB'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8200481 (Morrison et al. 1994)]. <br />Differential expression of ''ecmA'' and ''ecmB'' in the anterior zone has led to the identification of several different prestalk cell types: the pstA cells, located at the anterior-most region of the prestalk zone and characterized by high expression of the ''ecmA'' gene directed by the proximal part of its promoter (''ecmA'' promoter), the pstAB cells, forming a cone-shaped area of the prestalk zone that occupies a core among the pstA region in which cells express both the ecmA and ecmB genes, and the pstO cells, located posterior to the pstA zone and characterized by low expression of the ''ecmA'' gene directed by the distal part of its promoter (ecmO promoter) (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8016318 Williams and Morrison] in 1994). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-OCT-2003 PG
DDB_G0280971	Pascale Gaudet	Seven BEACH domain-containing proteins have been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA], [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB], [/gene/DDB_G0280971 lvsC], [/gene/DDB_G0271502 lvsD], [/gene/DDB_G0282925 lvsE], [/gene/DDB_G0284333 lvsF], and [/gene/DDB_G0268088 lvsG]. <br />Disruption mutants were created in ''lvsA-F''. Phenotypic analyses of these mutants indicate LvsC-F proteins are not required for cytokinesis, osmoregulation (contrary to [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA]), lysosomal traffic (unlike [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB]) or other processes such as growth and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3308452 Wang et al. 2002]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PG
DDB_G0286257	Petra Fey	The ''Dictyostelium'' ArgC enzyme is very similar to the bifunctional acetylglutamate kinase ([/ontology/go/3991/annotation/page/1 acetylglutamate kinase activity]) and N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase ([/ontology/go/3942/annotation/page/1 N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase activity]) from yeast (Arg5,6) that catalyzes the second and third steps in the biosynthesis of the arginine precursor ornithine ([/ontology/go/6592/annotation/page/1 ornithine biosynthetic process]). This protein contains an N-terminal acetylglutamate kinase (EC: 2.7.2.8) domain and a C-terminal N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase domain (EC: 1.2.1.38).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-FEB-2005 PF
DDB_G0284545	Pascale Gaudet	Sphingosine kinase phosphorylates sphingosine to form sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid signaling molecule involved in many varied cellular and physiological processes ([/ontology/go/0017050/annotation/page/1 D-erythro-sphingosine kinase activity], [/ontology/go/0006648/annotation/page/1 dihydrosphingosine-1-P pathway]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15059942 Saba and Hla, 2004]). ''Dictyostelium'', as human, yeast, and other eukaryotes, have two genes coding for sphingosine kinase, [/gene/DDB_G0272522 sgkA] and [/gene/DDB_G0284545 sgkB]. Biochemical properties of the SgkA and SgkB proteins demonstrate that they correspond to the human Sphk1 and Sphk2, respectively. SgkA is localized to the [/ontology/go/0005829/annotation/page/1 cytosol], the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus], and in some pseudopodia ([/ontology/go/0031143/annotation/page/1 pseudopodium]). Single and double knock outs showed that sphingosine kinase is involved in [/ontology/go/0008284/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of cell proliferation] and in resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15643073 Min et al., 2004]).

DDB_G0275267	Pascale Gaudet	The WRKY family proteins contain one or two WRKY domains, which consists of the heptapeptide WRKYGQK as well as a zinc-finger ([/ontology/go/0008270/annotation/page/1 zinc ion binding]). WRKY proteins have specific [/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding] activity towards the W-box, TTGAC(C/T). In plants, WRKY transcription factors control the expression of genes involved in many varied processes: responses to stress, including infection by pathogenic organisms,heat shock and cold shock, as well as many normal processes, such as growth and metabolism ([/ontology/go/0006355/annotation/page/1 regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent]). Outside the kingdom of plants, WRKY transcription factors have only been identified in ''Giardia lamblia'', a primitive eukaryote, and in ''Dictyostelium''. The implications of this observation have been analyzed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15629062 Zhang and Wang] in 2004.

Additionally, all Roco family members contain a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), with the exception of[/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7]. Other domains found in Roco proteins include WD40 repeats, cNB/CNMP (cyclicnucleotide binding), PH (pleckstrin homology), and RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) domains ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14654223 Bosgraaf and Van Haastert 2003]).

DDB_G0291842	Karen Kestin	The wee1 family of tyrosine kinases ([/ontology/go/0004713/annotation/page/1 protein-tyrosine kinase activity]) were originally identified in a screen formutants that undergo mitosis at a reduced cell size in the fission yeast ''Schizosaccharomycespombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7262540 Nurse and Thuriaux 1980]). Since then, members ofthe wee1 family have been shown to play an essential role in cell cycle regulation ([/ontology/go/0000074/annotation/page/1 regulation of progression through cell cycle]) in several other organisms, including thebudding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', the African clawed frog ''Xenopus laevis'', andseveral metazoans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Wee1 phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue on the mitosis promoting protein Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 ([/gene/DDB_G0272813 cdk1] in ''Dictyostelium''). Phosphorylation of this residue by Wee1 inhibits Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28,thereby delaying entry into mitosis from G2. Cdk1/Cdc2/Cdc28 is inactivated by dephosphorylation of thetyrosine residue by the phosphatase Cdc25/Mih1 ([/gene/DDB_G0283617 cdc25] in ''Dictyostelium''), allowingentry into mitosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625382 reviewed in Kellogg 2003]).<br />Three uncharacterized putative wee1 family members exist in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0291842 DDB_G0291842], [/gene/DDB_G0277539 DDB_G0277539], and [/gene/DDB_G0291133 DDB_G0291133].

DDB_G0283537	Pascale Gaudet	''rasS'' encodes a Ras subfamily protein ([/ontology/go/0005525/annotation/page/1 GTP binding]), ([/ontology/go/0003924/annotation/page/1 GTPase activity]). RasS has a single amino acid substitution in its effector domain (I36L), and several differences in the effector-proximal domain, a domain which is believed to play a role in Ras target activation, consistent with the idea that it has unique functions ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8290260 Daniel et al. 1993]). <br />The phenotype of a null mutant suggests that ''rasS'' plays roles in [/ontology/go/0050766/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of phagocytosis], [/ontology/go/0045807/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of endocytosis], [/ontology/go/0042127/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell proliferation], and [/ontology/go/0051271/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of cell motility]. ''rasS'' null cells exhibit morphological aberrations, with a significant proportion of the cortical F-actin relocalised to prominent pseudopodia ([/ontology/go/0030866/annotation/page/1 cortical actin cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis]). It has been proposed that rapid migration and endocytosis are mutually incompatible that RasS protein maintains the normal balance between these two processes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10652263 Chubb et al. 2000]).Since [/gene/DDB_G0269222 gefB] mutants have a phenotype highly similar to that of ''rasS-'' cells, it has been suggested that RasGEFB is the principal activator of the RasS protein [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11102804 (Wilkins et al. 2000)]; although there are differences in their motility defect ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12211111 Chubb et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12854977 Insall and King 2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-NOV-2004 PG

The [/gene/DDB_G0291834 cpiA](cystatin A1) protein is expressed throughout development, and is present in both soluble ([/ontology/go/0005625/annotation/page/1 soluble fraction]) and vesicular ([/ontology/go/0042598/annotation/page/1 vesicular fraction]) cell fractions. Expression of [/gene/DDB_G0280439 cpiB] (cystatin A2) is developmentally regulated; the protein is firstdetected at the aggregation stage and peaks during culmination. In a cell fractionation assay, the CpiB protein is detected solelyin the soluble fraction ([/ontology/go/0005625/annotation/page/1 soluble fraction]). Both CpiA and CpiB are capable of inhibiting cysteine proteases in vitro ([/ontology/go/0004869/annotation/page/1 cysteine protease inhibitor activity]),([/ontology/go/0006508/annotation/page/1 proteolysis]).

DDB_G0275123	Petra Fey	The AlyA protein has been purified from ''Dictyostelium'' cells as a major protein with [/ontology/go/0003796/annotation/page/1 lysozyme activity]. The protein sequence of this lysozyme was backtranslated and used to search the cDNA database, resulting in retrieval of the full ''alyA'' coding sequence. AlyA-GFP localized to numerous small vesicles ([/ontology/go/0016023/annotation/page/1 cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicle]) devoid of other known lysozymal enzymes, distributed throughout the cytoplasm.<br />Deletion of the alyA gene by homologues recombination resulted in a mutant that had only 40% of the wild-type lysozyme activity. When mutant cells were grown on bacteria, they initially made plaques that were only half the size measured in wild-type. However, repeated plating showed that the plaque size for mutants recovered over time, even surpassing that of wild-type. The larger plaque size occurred despite the constant lower level of enzyme activity. Uptake of fluoresently labeled yeast showed that the larger plaque size was due to increased [/ontology/go/0006909/annotation/page/1 phagocytosis]. Thus, the mutant seems to compensates a defect in digestion with an increase in food uptake. <br />A search of ''alyA''-similar ''Dictyostelium'' sequences resulted in the identification of two almost identical genes, [/gene/DDB_G0275119 alyB] and [/gene/DDB_G0275121 alyC], and two more distantly related genes: ''alyD'', (present in two copies chromosome 2: [/gene/DDB_G0273197 alyD-1], [/gene/DDB_G0273731 alyD-2]) and [/gene/DDB_G0286229 alyL]. These enzymes are not similar to any other known lysozymes. Thus, it has been suggested that the 4 proteins represent a new class of lysozymes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640146  (Mueller et al., 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-JAN-2005 PF

DDB_G0271494	Pascale Gaudet	''lrra'' encodes a protein with 19 leucine-rich repeats (LLRs). LRRs associate with Ras proteins to facilitate their interaction with other proteins.

The protein is localized to the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]. Null mutant in ''lrrA'' arrest at the mound stage and do not form a tip, indicating that they have defects in [/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development].

DDB_G0272799	Petra Fey	The ''icmA'' gene encodes the conserved isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase in ''Dictyostelium''. The protein was shown to have [/ontology/go/0004671/annotation/page/1 protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase activity]. The ''icmA''-null mutant shows defects in early development, such as no cell polarization ([/ontology/go/0030010/annotation/page/1 establishment of cell polarity]) or streaming, aberrant cAMP wave formation, and in some cases loose mound formation that may proceed to form aberrant fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0060176/annotation/page/1 regulation of aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). In the mutant, the starvation-induced expression of the cAMP receptor [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1] is delayed, also reflected in the fact that mutant membranes bind only 34% of the CAMP that wild-type membranes bind. However, in pulsed mutant cells the cAMP relay response is 3 times larger than in wild type. In addition, Ras GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) has been shown to be methylated and in the ''icmA''-null mutant RasG, as well as CRAC ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) are mislocalized in cAMP-pulsed cells. In sum, these data show that isoprenylcysteine methylation is required for signalling in response to cAMP ([/ontology/go/0008277/annotation/page/1 regulation of G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway]) and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699599 Chen et al. 2007)].

DDB_G0285343	Pascale Gaudet	Transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) is one of several factors that form part of a transcription preinitiation complex along with [/gene/DDB_G0288257 rpb2], the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP, encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0275617 tbpA] gene)and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) on the TATA-box sequence upstream of the initiation start site. TFIIA binds to TBP to stabilise TBP binding to the TATA element. In yeast, TFIIA is dispensable for accurate initiation of transcription but plays an important role in transcriptional activation, functioning as either an antirepressor or a coactivator. <br /> Human TFIIA and Drosophila TFIIA are composed of three subunits. The two larger subunits (alpha and beta) are encoded by the same gene and appear to be posttranslationally modified forms of a precursor protein. In yeast, two genes TOA1 and TOA2 are homologs of the large and the small subunits, respectively (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). In ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0290327 gtf2a1] encodes the large (alpha/beta) subunits and [/gene/DDB_G0285343 gtf2a2] encodes the small (gamma) subunit.

DDB_G0273175	Pascale Gaudet	Developing ''Dictyostelium'' cells aggregate to form fruiting bodies containing typically 2 x 10(4) cells. To prevent the formation of an excessively large fruiting body, streams of aggregating cells break up into groups if there are too many cells. The breakup is regulated by a secreted complex of polypeptides called counting factor (CF) ([/ontology/go/0005576/annotation/page/1 extracellular region]). CF is composed of at least 5 polypeptides, including Countin (encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] gene), cf50, and [/gene/DDB_G0269248 cf45-1]. CF50 is 30% identical to lysozyme (but has very little lysozyme activity) and contains distinctive serine-glycine motifs. Transformants with a disrupted CF50 gene, like countin(-) cells, form abnormally large groups ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]), exhibit increased levels of cytosolic glucose ([/ontology/go/0042593/annotation/page/1 glucose homeostasis]), increased cell-cell adhesion ([/ontology/go/0016337/annotation/page/1 cell-cell adhesion]) and decreased cell motility ([/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motility]). CF50 is present in the same fraction as the 450 kDa CF complex . In the absence of CF50, secreted countin is degraded, suggesting that one function of CF50 may be to protect countin from degradation ([/ontology/go/0045861/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of proteolysis]).

Also unlike countin, addition of recombinant CF50 decreases the cAMP pulse following stimulation with cAMP. Countin and CF50 require each other's presence to affect group size, but the presence of countin is not necessary for CF50 to bind to cells, and CF50 is not necessary for countin to bind to cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12117815 Brock et al.2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12912898 Brock et al. 2003]).

DDB_G0292564	Karen Kestin	The [/gene/DDB_G0292564 iplA] gene encodes a protein predicted to have [/ontology/go/0008095/annotation/page/1 inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor activity] by similarity to the human INSP3 receptor. The ''iplA'' transcript is expressed at low levels during growth and peaks at 9 h before declining. A null mutant of ''iplA'' lacks cAMP-stimulated Ca2+ uptake, however, its ability to chemotax towards cAMP is uninhibited ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10970875 Traynor et al. 2000]). Further analysis of ''iplA-'' cells by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15760480 Schaloske and colleagues (2005)] shows that while influx of extracellular Ca2+ is largely reduced, release of stored Ca2+ into the cytoplasm is intact. Inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry does in fact impair the ability of cells to chemotax towards cAMP.<br />Lam ''et al.'' showed that mutation of the ''iplA'' gene inhibited [/ontology/go/0048102/annotation/page/1 autophagic cell death], suggesting that Ca2+ flux is necessary to signal this cell death. In addition, ''iplA''/[/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1] double null cells showed a variable and partial inhibition of necrotic cell death ([/ontology/go/0016244/annotation/page/1 non-apoptotic programmed cell death]), suggesting a lesser role for iplA in this form of cell death ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18077554 Lam et al. 2008]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 5-MAY-2008 PF

DDB_G0277759	Karen Kestin	The [/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA] gene encodes a prolyl 4-hydroxylase that catalyzes the hydroxylation ofProline 143 of the Skp1 ([/gene/DDB_G0269230 fpaA]/[/gene/DDB_G0273251 fpaB-1])protein. HyPro143 is subsequently glycosylated by a series of reactions; this post-translational modification is necessaryfor nuclear enrichment of Skp1, a wild-type behavior ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8287496 Sassi et al. 2001]).The PhyA protein is predicted to be related to the mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase(P4H). This similarity is further evidenced by common properties, such as enzyme kinetics and cofactors, shared by the PhyA protein and P4H ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB4889 van der Welet al. 2005]).<br />The initial step in Skp1 glycosylation involves the hydroxylation of Pro143 by a proline hydroxylase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB10218 Teng-umnuay et al.1998]), later shown to be encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0277759 phyA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB4889 van der Wel et al. 2005]). HyPro143 is then modified by [/gene/DDB_G0275699 gnt1], which transfers aGlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) to the Skp1 protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB10885 Teng-umnuay et al.1999]). A bifunctional glycosyltransferase, [/gene/DDB_G0283761 pgtA],processively adds galactose and fucose to the GlcNAc ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2182323 van der Wel et al.2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB5498 van der Wel et al. 2002]). Subsequentglycosylation events transfer two additional galactose residues to the chain; the first of which is likelycatalyzed by [/gene/DDB_G0283005 agtA] (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB670 West etal. 2004]). The resulting pentasaccharide is as follows: Gal-Gal-Fuc-Gal-GlcNAc-HyPro143-Skp1.<br />A ''phyA'' null mutant lacks Skp1 hydroxylation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/PUB4889 van der Wel et al. 2005]) and is unable to culminate under normal conditions; this defect is rescued at high oxygen concentrations (40-70%). ''in situ'' staining with an antibody raised against P4H1 shows that it is constitutively expressed in tipped mounds and slugs. Interestingly, the Skp1 hydroxylation and development defects of the ''phyA'' null mutant can be rescued by expressing ''phyA'' either in prespore or prestalk cells. Active P4H1 was required for complementation, as a mutant with no activity, R276A, failed to culminate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699611 West et al. 2007]).

DDB_G0282835	Pascale Gaudet	The MADS-box (for the initials of the first identified members: MCM1, ARG80 from yeast, Deficient from Arabidopsis and SRF from humans) is a in a highly conserved60 amino-acid region that contain a dimerization and a DNA-binding domain ([/ontology/go/0003700/annotation/page/1 transcription factor activity]), ([/ontology/go/0006355/annotation/page/1 regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent]). The serum response factor (SRF) is a DNA-binding proteininvolved in the transcriptional activation ofgenes in response to serum in cultured mammalian cells (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9729488 Escalante and Sastre 1998] and references therein).There are 4 predicted proteins that contain a MADS box in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA], [/gene/DDB_G0282835 srfB], [/gene/DDB_G0268920 srfC], and [/gene/DDB_G0283483 srfD].<br />''srfB'' is expressed in vegetative cells as well as during late aggregation (6-12h). Its promoter has three different transcription start sites active in different cell types. Null mutants of ''srfB'' have a number of different phenotypes: accelerated aggregation, abolished streaming, decreased growth rate, aberrant cytokinesis, and increased pinocytosis. The developmental defects can be rescued by providing cAMP pulses, indicating that at last some of the defects observed are due to aberrant cAMP signaling ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339368 Galardi-Castilla et al. 2008]).

DDB_G0288247	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' AIF, which is very similar to human AIFM1, has been shown to localize to the [/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion] in living cells, and to translocate to the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus] during cell death. The activity of DdAIF was tested by using cytoplasmic extract from Dictyos cells, incubating the extract either with human or ''Dictyostelium'' nuclei. In both assays, the extract caused [/ontology/go/0030261/annotation/page/1 chromosome condensation] and DNA degradation [/ontology/go/0006308/annotation/page/1 DNA catabolic process] . Polyclonal DdAIF antibodies inhibited the nuclear degradation process.

DDB_G0267956	Pascale Gaudet	AbiA is part of the SCAR complex consisting of [/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA], [/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA], [/gene/DDB_G0279175 hspc300], [/gene/DDB_G0287855 pirA] (PIR121), and [/gene/DDB_G0274519 napA] and involved in [/ontology/go/0030838/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of actin filament polymerization]. Abi2 interacts directly with SCAR but not with Hspc300 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416346 Caracino et al. 2007]). <br />In other species, removal of any of the SCAR components leads to the disappearing of the entire complex. A null mutant in ''abiA'' has ScrA levels reduced by approximately 5-fold, but normal levels of PIR121. In the abiA- mutant, ScrA and PIR121 fail to localize to te pseudopod upon chemotactic stimulation and the mutant has reduced chemotaxis rate. abiA- cells also show reduced growth rates due to a defect in cytokinesis, as seen by the 2-fold increase in number of mutinucleated cells. abiA- null cells develop normally. A double abiA-/scrA- mutant has defects similar to scrA- alone: smaller cell size and reduced cell motility. Those results show that the different SCAR components have some unique roles ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18261908 Pollitt and Insall 2008]).

DDB_G0278077	Pascale Gaudet	The CRTF protein was isolated from nuclear extracts ([/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]) by its ability to bind the [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1] promoter. The deduced CRTFprotein is ~100 kDa with a C-terminal, zinc finger-likemotif required for DNA binding ([/ontology/go/0042156/annotation/page/1 zinc-mediated transcriptional activator activity]). ''crtf''-null strains fail to developunder standard conditions ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]) or to exhibit induced expressionof ''carA'' or other cAMP-regulated genes ([/ontology/go/0045941/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of transcription]). Furthermore,''crtf''-nulls fail to sporulate ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]), even under conditions thatbypass the dependence on early cAMP signaling pathways.Early developmental events of ''crtf''-null strainscan be rescued with exogenous cAMP treatment,constitutive expression of CAR1 or co-development withwild-type cells; however, these treatments are insufficientto promote sporulation. This suggests a cell-autonomousrole for CRTF during late development that is separatefrom its capacity to control ''carA'' expression ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11493573 Mu et al. 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-MAY-2004 PG

The expression of countin3 is observed in the vegetatively growing cells, decreases in the aggregating stage, increases in the mid-developmental stage and decreases again in subsequent stages.

DDB_G0283607	Pascale Gaudet	EB1 proteins are microtubule-associated proteins involved in [/ontology/go/0000022/annotation/page/1 mitotic spindle elongation]. ''Dictyostelium'' EB1 localizes along [/ontology/go/0005874/annotation/page/1 microtubule]s, at the [/ontology/go/0005813/annotation/page/1 centrosome], and at protruding pseudopods ([/ontology/go/0031143/annotation/page/1 pseudopodium]). During mitosis, it is found at the [/ontology/go/0005819/annotation/page/1 spindle], [/ontology/go/0000922/annotation/page/1 spindle pole]s, and [/ontology/go/0000776/annotation/page/1 kinetochore]. EB1 colocalizes with DdCP224, the XMAP215 homolog encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0268616 mtaA] gene. EB1 protein deletions indicate that microtubule binding requires homo-oligomerization, which is mediated by a coiled-coil domain. The ''EB1'' null mutant has defects in [/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis] due to poor [/ontology/go/0051227/annotation/page/1 mitotic spindle assembly] during [/ontology/go/0000236/annotation/page/1 mitotic prometaphase] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12134070 Rehberg and Graf 2002]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-NOV-2003 PG

DDB_G0282817	Petra Fey	PAT2 is a ''Dictyostelium'' P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase that is very similar to plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-transporting ATPases (proton pumps) ([/ontology/go/0015992/annotation/page/1 proton transport]) of plants and fungi. The ''patB'' gene is expressed at low levels in cells growing at neutral pH, but it is up-regulated significantly when cells are shifted to an acidic medium. Immunofluorescence experiments showed PAT2 localization at the plasma [/ontology/go/0016020/annotation/page/1 membrane]. ''patB''-null cells grew and developed normally at neutral pH, but where unable to grow at pH 5. At pH 6.8, wild-type and knock-out cells exhibited similar levels of vanadate-sensitive [/ontology/go/0016887/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity], but when cells were transferred to pH 5 the activity increased rapidly in wild-type, but not in the mutant. These results suggest that PAT2 is an acid-inducible P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase that is essential for survival of ''Dictyostelium'' amoebae in acidic medium [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9421912  (Coukell et al. 1997)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-JUL-2005 PF
DDB_G0289179	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), encoded by the ''thyB'' gene, has been isolated by its [/ontology/go/0005516/annotation/page/1 calmodulin binding] activity. The 25.5 kDa protein contains a CaM binding domain and an [/ontology/go/0005524/annotation/page/1 ATP binding] domain, and is very similar to mammalian thymidine kinases, also evident in the fact that human TK1 antibodies recognize the ''Dictyostelium'' protein. Calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) binding of TK1 has been shown to be Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent. Both proteins, TK1 and calmodulin, are expressed strongest in vegetative, proliferating cells, after which expression declines. Recombinant TK1 has [/ontology/go/0004797/annotation/page/1 thymidine kinase activity], and this activity is regulated by calmodulin [/ontology/go/0004638/annotation/page/1 phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase activity]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15883042 (O'Day et al. 2005)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-JUL-2005 PF
DDB_G0292850	Pascale Gaudet	In mammalian cells, phosducin binds to G proteins and modulate their activity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there are three groups of phodsucin proteins. ''Dictyostelium'', like mammalian cells and ''Drosophila'', has one member from each group: [/gene/DDB_G0292850 phlp1], [/gene/DDB_G0285433 phlp2], and [/gene/DDB_G0293848 phlp3]. Phosducins consist of an N-terminal domain containing three helices which binds the alpha subunit of G proteins, and a C-terminal domain which bears similarity to thioredoxin and binds to the beta/gamma subunit of G proteins. <br />Phlp1 contains all the conserved residues necessary for Galpha and Gbeta/gamma binding. Disruption of the ''phlp1'' gene causes numerous defects. The mutant grows slowly both on bacteria and in axenic medium. The mutant fails to aggregate ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]), and that defect is not rescued with mixing with wild-type cells or with exogenous cAMP. The mutant also has defects in [/ontology/go/0043327/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis to cAMP] and [/ontology/go/0043326/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis to folate]. The mutant has several defects in cAMP signaling: the number of high affinity cAMP binding sites on the cell membranes is significantly reduced, and the mutant fails to produce cAMP or cGMP following cAMP stimulus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14517243 Blaauw et al. 2003]). <br />The phenotype of ''phlp1'' null cells is very similar to that of Gbeta ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) null cells. In support of a link between G proteins and Phlp1, Gbeta and Ggamma are mislocalized in ''phlp1''- cells: there are found in the cytosol rather than on the cell surface. Also, Gbeta and Ggamma are present as monomers rather than associated together. Finally, Ggamma is not prenylated, neither in ''phlp1''- nor in ''gpaB''- cells. This data, together with evidence obtained in other systems, is consistent with a model where Phlp1 plays a role in the heterodimerization of Gbeta and Ggamma, which is presumed to be necessary for prenylation of Ggamma and its association with plasma membranes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16135826 Knol et al. 2005]).

DDB_G0293530	Karen Kestin	The [/gene/DDB_G0291081 pefA] and [/gene/DDB_G0293530 pefB] genes were identified as homologs of mammalian ALG-2 (<u>a</u>poptosis-<u>l</u>inked <u>g</u>ene 2), which is involved in programmed cell death, as its name suggests. The PefA and PefB proteins eachcontain five calcium-binding ([/ontology/go/0005509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding]) EF hand motifs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al.2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al. 2002]).<br />Expression of ''pefB'' mRNA is developmentally regulated; the message peaks at 4-8 hours, followed by a rapid decline([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al. 2002]). PefBhas been shown to localize intracellularly to the cytoplasm ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]), the nucleus ([/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]) and, in the presenceof calcium, to the membrane fraction ([/ontology/go/0005624/annotation/page/1 membrane fraction]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001],[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry et al. 2002]). In situ hybridization analysis of '' pefB'' shows expression inthe anterior tip of the prestalk region ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481037 Ohkouchi et al. 2001]).<br />In surface plasmon resonance experiments, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11927596 Aubry and colleagues (2002)] demonstrate thatPefA is capable of dimerizing with itself ([/ontology/go/0042803/annotation/page/1 protein homodimerization activity]), PefB ([/ontology/go/0046982/annotation/page/1 protein heterodimerization activity]), and with murine Alix (ALG-2 interacting protein X, homolog of ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0275451 alxA]). PefB, on the other hand, heterodimerizes ([/ontology/go/0046982/annotation/page/1 protein heterodimerization activity]) with PefA but fails to dimerize with murineAlix. Additionally, they show that null mutants of both '' pefA'' and ''pefB'' and double mutants ''pefA-''/''pefB-'' have no detectable developmental phenotype.<br />[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950752 Lardy et al. 2005] recently found that pefB acts as a supressor in mutant strains of the NADPH oxidase large subunits [/gene/DDB_G0289653 noxA] and [/gene/DDB_G0287101 noxB], and the small subunit [/gene/DDB_G0267460 cybA].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 08-SEP-2004 KP
DDB_G0289067	Karen Kestin	The [/gene/DDB_G0289067 smkA] gene was first identified as a suppressor of the [/gene/DDB_G0269152 mekA] null chemotaxis phenotype.In addition to a chemotaxis phenotype, cells lacking ''smkA'' are defective in cytokinesis when grown in suspension andhave greatly reduced levels of myosin II ([/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]). The ''smkA'' gene product, SMEK, is highly conservedacross species and contains an EVH1 domain, however, its function is unknown. SMEK localizes to the [/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex] duringgrowth and translocates to the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus] during development via its NLS ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16107728 Mendoza et al. 2005]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-SEP-2005 KP

Recombinant Ugt52 is capable of adding glucose several sterolsubstrates, including cholesterol, ergosterol, beta-sitosterol, and tomatidine.

DDB_G0276759	Pascale Gaudet	The ''cbpA'' gene encodes a [/ontology/go/0005509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding] protein, CBP1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7729526 Coukell et al. 2000]). CBP1 associates with the [/ontology/go/0015629/annotation/page/1 actin cytoskeleton] during development. ''cbpA''-null cells grow normally, but exhibits delayed aggregation when developed in submerged conditions. This defect in aggregation appears to be related to a general reduction in [/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motility] rather than to defect in the cAMP signaling cascade. Together, these results suggest that CBP1 might function to help regulate the reorganization of the ''Dictyostelium'' actin cytoskeleton during aggregation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10896781 Dharamsi et al. 2000]).<br />CBP1 has been shown to interact with two other calcium-binding proteins, encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0283153 cbpD1] and [/gene/DDB_G0283083 cbpD2] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10771103 Dorywalskal et al. 2000]). It also interacts with protovilin ([/gene/DDB_G0276453 vilB]) and EF-1 alpha ([/gene/DDB_G0269134 efaAI]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10896781 Dharamsi et al. 2000]).

DDB_G0275931	Pascale Gaudet	NCS-1/frequenin proteins regulate a variety of cellular processes, including neurotrasmitter release, cyclic nucleotide metabolism, polyphosphoinositide synthesis, gene expression, and protein secretion. A member of this family, ''ncsA'' has been identified in ''Dictyostelium''. NcsA exhibits [/ontology/go/0005509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding] activity. The ''ncsA'' transcript is maximally expressed during late aggregation and the slug stage. ''ncsA''-null cells grow normally in axenic culture but grows slowly on bacterial lawns. Development of ''ncsA''-null cells is accelerated by 3-4 h compared to wild type cells. Unlike the ''S. cerevisiae'' and mammalian NCS1, NcsA does not appear to interact with PI4K ([/gene/DDB_G0288485 pikD]) and therefore its mode of action has yet to be elucidated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15606490 Coukell et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 04-JAN-2005 PG

DDB_G0288047	Pascale Gaudet	There are six subfamilies of DNA methyltransferases. ''Dictyostelium'' has a single cytosine-5-methyltransferase, DnmA, which belongs to the dnmt2 subfamily. Members of this family have weak or undetectable methylase activity. When activity is observed, it is against substrates containing a thymidine 3' of the cytosine, rather than a guanine as other cytosine-5-methyltransferases ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15689527 Ponger and Li, 2005]). <br />Consistent with these predictions, no methylation has been detected on CG islands in the Dictyostelium genome ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1713034 Smith and Ratner, 1991]). Instead, low levels of [/ontology/go/0006306/annotation/page/1 DNA methylation] has been observed on sites with no obvious sequence preferences. DNA methylation is dependent on the presence of DnmA, as it is greatly reduced in the null mutant, indicating that DnmA has  ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16282589 Kuhlmann et al., 2005], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16400165 Katoh et al., 2006]). Kuhlmann and colleagues have noticed that after several passages through growth and development stages, expression of two retrotransposable elements, Skipper and DIRS-1, is greatly increased in the ''dnmA'' null mutant. Null mutants for two other genes involved in RNAi silencing, [/gene/DDB_G0273051 drnA-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0283023 hcpA], also exhibit increased expression of Skipper and DIRS-1. Katoh ''et al.'' report a modest developmental defect of [/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development], as well as a reduction in [/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation] efficiency.

DDB_G0267490	Pascale Gaudet	The ChLim protein contains a N-terminal Calponin Homology (CH) domain, 3 LIM domains, and 4 LIM-related domains (LRDs). This topology is unique, although there are proteins in other organisms that have both CH and LIM domains. <br />ChLim was isolated as an interacting partner of [/gene/DDB_G0275157 limF], as was [/gene/DDB_G0286553 rab21], a small GTPase of the Rab subfamily. ChLim and LimF interaction with Rab21 is not dependent on the ability of Rab21 to bind GTP. Mutations in these three genes indicate that ChLim play a role in the [/ontology/go/0050765/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of phagocytosis], while LimF and Rab21 are involved in the [/ontology/go/0050766/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of phagocytosis]. Consistent with this, during phagocytosis, ChLim is found in the [/ontology/go/0001891/annotation/page/1 phagocytic cup] and remains associated with the [/ontology/go/0045335/annotation/page/1 phagocytic vesicle].

''Dictyostelium'' PldG is similar to PLD found inbacteria, yeast, and humans in both amino acid sequence and in predicted secondary structure ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15225639 Rigden 2004]). The ''pldG'' transcript is expressed in PstO cells during thedevelopmental program ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796308 Maeda et al. 2003]).<br />In addition to pldG, three homologs of mammalian phospholipase D1 (PLD1) are present the genome: [/gene/DDB_G0281031 pldA], [/gene/DDB_G0279483 pldB], and [/gene/DDB_G0277949 pldC].

Through micrococcal nuclease digestion, they showed that a lysine-rich proteinfunctions as an H1 histone to bring the two DNA strands together at their exit point from the nucleosome. HistoneH1 was later cloned by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7867938 Hauser and colleagues (1995)], who showed throughSouthern blot analysis that H1 exists in a single copy in the ''Dicytostelium'' genome. Their protein sequenceanalysis revealed the presence of the globular domain found higher eukaryotes and a putative cdc2 kinasephosphorylation site. They did not find, however, a nucleotide binding loop or a consensus cAMP-dependent phosphorylationsite. This is consistent with the findings of [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1321059 Heads et al.

DDB_G0281827	Pascale Gaudet	The ''dwwA'' gene is required for [/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis] of ''Dictyostelium'' cells on solid surfaces. Its product, DwwA, contains two WW domains, an IQ motif, a C2 domain and a proline-rich region. DwwA is localized to the [/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex] and the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]; the N-terminal half of the protein, which contains the C2 domain, is required for the cortical localization of DWWA. ''dwwA''-null cells have higher levels of F-actin around the periphery of the ventral surface of the cell ([/ontology/go/0007015/annotation/page/1 actin filament organization]). The IQ motif of DwwA binds [/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA] ''in vitro'' ([/ontology/go/0005516/annotation/page/1 calmodulin binding]). DwwA has been proposed to function as an adaptor protein, participating in cytokinesis by mediating the interaction of Ca(2+)/calmodulin with the actin cytoskeleton ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14595117 Nagasaki and Uyeda 2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-NOV-2003 PG
DDB_G0293848	Pascale Gaudet	In mammalian cells, phosducin binds to G proteins and modulate their activity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there are three groups of phodsucin proteins. ''Dictyostelium'', like mammalian cells and ''Drosophila'', has one member from each group: [/gene/DDB_G0292850 phlp1], [/gene/DDB_G0285433 phlp2], and [/gene/DDB_G0293848 phlp3]. Phosducins consist of an N-terminal domain containing three helices which binds the alpha subunit of G proteins, and a C-terminal domain which bears similarity to thioredoxin and binds to the beta/gamma subunit of G proteins. <br />Phlp3 completely lacks the helix involved in G beta/gamma binding. Disruption of the ''phlp3'' gene caused no defect in growth, development, or chemotaxis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/199357 Blaauw et al. 2003]).

DDB_G0284791	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium cpnC'' belongs to the highly conserved copines, a family of ubiquitious Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding ([/ontology/go/0005544/annotation/page/1 calcium-dependent phospholipid binding]) proteins. In their N-terminal half, copines contain two Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding domains (C2 domains) present in such proteins as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Much of the C-terminal half consists of a von Willebrand Factor type A domain (VWFA) typically found in the extracellular portions of membrane proteins like integrins. Thus copines represent a fusion of intracellular (C2) and extracellular (VWFA) domains. However, there are no signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane sequences in the predicted proteins suggesting copines are intracellular proteins. Copines are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking. It is of particular interest that copines, first found in the highly phagocytic protozoan ''Paramecium'' and then isolated from mammalian spleen and liver, seem to be abundant in cells and organs that are, or contain, phagocytes. In this context it comes as no surprise that phagocytic ''Dictyostelium'' has a total of six copine genes[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343335  (Damer et al. 2005)]. The widespread distribution of copines from protozoans to mammals and their high similarity suggest they play important role(s) in eukaryotic biology.

DDB_G0289555	Karen Kestin	The ''arkA'' gene was identified in a screen for suppressors of the protein phosphatase [/gene/DDB_G0276155 spnA]mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14597204 Aubry et al. 2003]). ArkA contains several functionaldomains, including a protein kinase domain ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) that is classified in the tyrosine kinase-like (TKL)group of protein kinases. The ''arkA'' transcript is developmentally regulated such that two peaks inexpression are detected by Northern blot at 8 hours and 15 hours after starvation. Spatial expression of thetranscript is highly enriched in the prestalk region in the slug and in the stalk and the tip of the fruitingbody. Subcellular localization is detected in the cortex, most likely associated with the cytoskeleton ([/ontology/go/0030863/annotation/page/1 cortical cytoskeleton]).<br />Disruption of the ''arkA'' gene results in abnormal fruiting bodies, whereas overexpression results in severemorphological defects ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). Expression levels of developmental markers [/gene/DDB_G0280531 lagC], [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA],and [/gene/DDB_G0277141 cotC] are not affected in ''arkA-'' cells, however, the spore-specific [/gene/DDB_G0289075 spiA] transcript is elevated in comparison to wild-type. Additionally, yeast two-hybrid analysis showsthat ArkA interacts with 14-3-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) and [/gene/DDB_G0292998 rasB] but not with [/gene/DDB_G0292996 rasD], [/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG], or [/gene/DDB_G0283537 rasS] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14597204 Aubry et al.2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-NOV-2004 KP

Overexpression of ''spkA'' in wild-type cells results in defects inthese processes as well, in addition to an increase in F-actin levels ([/ontology/go/0030036/annotation/page/1 actin cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis]). The kinase activity of SpkA isupregulated by hyperosmolarity and heat shock ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14593072 Sun et al. 2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-OCT-2004 KP

DDB_G0267688	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium cpnD'' belongs to the highly conserved copines, a family of ubiquitious Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding ([/ontology/go/0005544/annotation/page/1 calcium-dependent phospholipid binding]) proteins. In their N-terminal half, copines contain two Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding domains (C2 domains) present in such proteins as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Much of the C-terminal half consists of a von Willebrand Factor type A domain (VWFA) typically found in the extracellular portions of membrane proteins like integrins. Thus copines represent a fusion of intracellular (C2) and extracellular (VWFA) domains. However, there are no signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane sequences in the predicted proteins suggesting copines are intracellular proteins. Copines are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking. It is of particular interest that copines, first found in the highly phagocytic protozoan ''Paramecium'' and then isolated from mammalian spleen and liver, seem to be abundant in cells and organs that are, or contain, phagocytes. In this context it comes as no surprise that phagocytic ''Dictyostelium'' has a total of six copine genes[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343335  (Damer et al. 2005)]. The widespread distribution of copines from protozoans to mammals and their high similarity suggest they play important role(s) in eukaryotic biology.

''lvsB'' mutant cells exhibit enhanced regulated secretion of lysosomal enzymes, a phenotype reminiscent of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11865029 Cornillon et al. 2002]). They also appear to have enlarged acidic lysosomes, probably due to an increase in fusion rates and suggesting that LvsB acts as a negative regulator of fusion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11854420 Harris et al. 2002]). Consistent with its requirement for proper lysosome organization, LvsB is localized to the [/ontology/go/0005764/annotation/page/1 lysosome] and [/ontology/go/0045335/annotation/page/1 phagocytic vesicle] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488289 Kypri et al. 2007]).<br />Seven BEACH domain-containing proteins have been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA], [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB], [/gene/DDB_G0280971 lvsC], [/gene/DDB_G0271502 lvsD], [/gene/DDB_G0282925 lvsE], [/gene/DDB_G0284333 lvsF], and [/gene/DDB_G0268088 lvsG].

In addition to the N-terminal 5-phosphate catalytic domain, ''Dd5P4'' contains a C-terminal RhoGAP domain.

DDB_G0267830	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' GemA is a member of the evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial Rho (Miro) subgroup of GTPases. These are large, atypical Rho GTPases that recently have been described as Ras-related GTPases. They have a unique domain organisation with tandem GTP-binding domains and two EF hand domains that may bind calcium ([/ontology/go/5509/annotation/page/1 calcium ion binding]). The yeast Gem1p is a tail-anchored [/ontology/go/5741/annotation/page/1 mitochondrial outer membrane] protein that regulates mitochondrial morphology. ''Dictyostelium'' GemA contains a putative C-terminal transmembrane domain, which might anchor the protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JAN-2006 PF

DDB_G0285161	Pascale Gaudet	The ''dagA'' gene product CRAC is required for [/ontology/go/0045762/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of adenylate cyclase activity] ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]). The null mutant exhibits defects in [/ontology/go/0006935/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis] and is unable to complete development ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8089184 Insall et al. 1994]). Upon stimulation with cAMP, CRAC is translocated from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction ([/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm]), ([/ontology/go/0019897/annotation/page/1 extrinsic to plasma membrane]). This translocation requires the G-protein beta subunit ([/gene/DDB_G0277143 gpbA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7790361  (Lilly and Devreotes 1995)]. CRAC associates with the plasma membrane at the leading edge of the membrane through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This localized activation transmitted by the recruitment of cytosolic proteins leads to a localized response allowing the cells to move in the direction of the chemoattractant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9778249 Parent et al. 1998]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG
DDB_G0276887	Pascale Gaudet	FbxA belongs to a family of proteins that contain an F-box and WD40 repeats and that target specific proteins for degradation via proteasomes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898960 Nelson et al. 2001]). The F-box is a protein motif of approximately 50 amino acids that functions as a site of protein-protein interaction ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11178263 Kipreos and Pagano 2000]). This class of protein usually forms part of a <u>S</u>kp1, <u>C</u>ullin, <u>F</u>-box [/ontology/go/0019005/annotation/page/1 SCF ubiquitin ligase complex] that targets specific protein substrates for ubiquitination and degradation ([/ontology/go/0006511/annotation/page/1 ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725352 Ennis et al. 2000]).One of the targets of FbxA is the cAMP phosphodiesterase [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796307 Tekinay et al. 2003]).<br />In fruiting bodies formed from ''fbxA'' null cells, most structures arrest at the mound stage, and in those that progress further the spore mass fails to fully ascend the stalk. The development of ''fbxA'' null cells is hypersensitive to ammonia, the signaling molecule that regulates [/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development]. In ''fbxA'' null slugs the pstO region is reduced in size and the prespore region is proportionately expanded ([/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898960 Nelson et al. 2001]). ''fbxA'' (Cheater A) was independently isolated as a ''Dictyostelium'' mutant that preferentially form spores in chimeras with isogenic wild-type cells. The mutant causes wild-type cells that have begun to express spore-specific genes to accumulate in the prestalk compartment of the developing organism ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725352 Ennis et al. 2000]).<br />The ''fbxA'' transcript is absent in growing cells and appears early in development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725352 Ennis et al. 2000]) and is highly enriched in the prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898960 Nelson et al. 2001]). <br />Overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit, [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], rescues many of the defects of ''fbxA'' null cells, suggesting a regulatory role for FbxA proteins in PKA function. FbxA is believed to regulate multicellular development together with [/gene/DDB_G0291972 culA] by targeting [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] for degradation via a pathway that requires [/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB] function, leading to an increase in cAMP and PKA activity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390363 Mohanty et al. 2001]).Null mutations in [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] or [/gene/DDB_G0280961 dhkA] partially restores the developmental defects observed in ''fbxA'' null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796307 Tekinay et al. 2003]). <br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

DDB_G0281381	Pascale Gaudet	''Dictyostelium'' is the simplest organism known to employ STAT signaling. STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are characterized by a DNA binding domain, an SH2 domain, and a site of tyrosine phosphorylation. A STAT becomes activated when a ligand binds to its receptor, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the monomeric STAT molecule. Four STATs have been identified in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA], [/gene/DDB_G0268638 dstB], [/gene/DDB_G0293532 dstC] and [/gene/DDB_G0275167 dstD]. <br />STATa was first identified biochemically, as the TTGA-binding factor that binds in vitro to the [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA] activator and [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB] repressor elements ([/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding]) (Kawata ''et al.'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8670809 1996], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9200609 1997]), and genetically in a REMI screen for mutants that are blocked in fruiting-body formation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10393118 Mohanty et al. 1999]). During development, STATa is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to cAMP in a [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1]-dependent manner. By the mound stage most of STATa is translocated in the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]. STATa is downregulated by [/gene/DDB_G0273097 ptpA1-1] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11254360 Early et al. 2001]). ''dstA''-null organisms do not culminate ([/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development]) and form structures that lack stalk cells ([/ontology/go/0031149/annotation/page/1 sorocarp stalk cell differentiation]) and a stalk tube, although the cells differentiate into stalk cells in culture ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10393118 Mohanty et al. 1999]).The structure of activated STATa has been solved in the absence of DNAand provides important insights into the regulation of the activity of STATs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15053873 Soler-Lopez et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-MAY-2004 PG
DDB_G0268638	Pascale Gaudet	''Dictyostelium'' is the simplest organism known to employ STAT signaling. STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are characterized by a DNA binding domain, an SH2 domain, and a site of tyrosine phosphorylation. A STAT becomes activated when a ligand binds to its receptor, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the monomeric STAT molecule. Four STATs have been identified in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA], [/gene/DDB_G0268638 dstB], [/gene/DDB_G0293532 dstC] and [/gene/DDB_G0275167 dstD]. <br />STATb was isolated by low stringency hybridization using the SH2 domain of STATa as a probe. STATb displays a 15 amino acid insertion in its SH2 domain and the conserved and essential arginine residue,which interacts with phosphotyrosine in all other known SH2 domains, is substituted by leucine. Despite these abnormalities, STATb is biologically functional and is found as a homodimer in the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus]. ''dstB''-null cells aregradually lost from the population when they are co-culturedwith parental cells ([/ontology/go/0001558/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell growth]). Microarray analysis lead to the identification of several genes that are either underexpressed ([/ontology/go/0016563/annotation/page/1 transcription activator activity]) oroverexpressed ([/ontology/go/0016564/annotation/page/1 transcription repressor activity]) in the ''dstB'' null strain ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14701681 Zhukovskaya et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-MAY-2004 PG
DDB_G0274597	Pascale Gaudet	Developing ''Dictyostelium'' cells aggregate to form fruiting bodies. The size of the aggregate is in part regulated by a secreted complex of polypeptides called counting factor (CF) ([/ontology/go/0005576/annotation/page/1 extracellular region]). CF is composed of at least 5 polypeptides, including Countin (encoded by the [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] gene), [/gene/DDB_G0273175 cf50-1] and [/gene/DDB_G0269248 cf45-1]. In transformants with a disrupted ''ctnA'' gene, the aggregation streams do not break up, resulting in huge fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0031158/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of aggregate size involved in sorocarp development]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10444594 Brock and Gomer 1999]). <br />CF regulates group size by [/ontology/go/0007162/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of cell adhesion] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090633 Roisin-Bouffay et al. 2001]), down-regulating the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse through inhibition of guanylyl cyclase activity ([/ontology/go/0030827/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of cGMP biosynthetic process]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11371560 Tang et al. 2001]), and decreasing cAMP-stimulated cAMP pulse. In contrast, recombinant countin potentiates the cAMP pulse ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14557265 Brock et al. 2003]). The presence of countin enhances the cAMP-stimulated transient translocation of [/gene/DDB_G0268620 pkbA] and [/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA] from the cytosol to membranes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15470246 Gao et al. 2004]).CF increases [/ontology/go/0030041/annotation/page/1 actin filament polymerization] and myosin phosphorylation and redistribution ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11818526 Tang et al. 2002]). The specific roles of countin have been investigated by comparing the effect of addition of recombinant countin to cells compared to addition of semi-purified countin. The responses to recombinant countin and CF are similar with respect to cAMP signal transduction, and [/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motility]. However, countin does not decrease cell-cell adhesion or group size to the extent that semipurified CF does ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12070154 Gao et al. 2002]). Cells lacking bioactive CF have high glucose levels, whereas transformants oversecreting CF have low glucose levels ([/ontology/go/0042593/annotation/page/1 glucose homeostasis]). Adding exogenous glucose negates the effect of high levels of extracellular CF on group size and mimics the effect of depleting CF on glucose levels, cell-cell adhesion, cAMP pulse size, actin polymerization, myosin assembly, and motility. These results suggest that glucose is a downstream component in part of the CF signaling pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12161440 Jang et al. 2002]). Supporting this, it has been shown that CF decreases the activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15643062 Jang and Gomer 2005]). <br />CF is oversecreted in [/gene/DDB_G0287587 smlA] mutants ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10444594 Brock and Gomer 1999]). Secreted countin appears to be protected from degradation by [/gene/DDB_G0273175 cf50-1] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12117815 Brock et al.2002]). The eIF2alpha kinase [/gene/DDB_G0272837 ifkA] can stabilize and enhance the translational efficiency of countin mRNA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12697064 Fang et al.2003]).<br />Countin represents a new family within the amoebapore superfamily of proteins based on the presence of three predicted disulfide bridges and a tertiary structure similar to that of other members of the superfamily. Amoebapore superfamily proteins bind membranes and are extremely stable ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10998571 Zhai and Saier 2000]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-OCT-2003 PG
DDB_G0277403	Pascale Gaudet	Clathrin is part of the vesicles coat involved in [/ontology/go/0006897/annotation/page/1 endocytosis] from the plasma membrane, as well as traffic from endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. The clathrin protein is composed of three 190-kDa heavy chains (encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0277221 chcA]) and three ~30-kDa light chains (encoded by ''clc'') to form the clathrin triskelion ([/ontology/go/0030118/annotation/page/1 clathrin coat]). Clathrin heavy chains from different species are highly conserved, while clathrin light chains are much more divergent. <br />Unlike the [/gene/DDB_G0277221 chcA] mutant, ''clc'' null cells grow normally on solid substratum and have pinocytosis rates similar to that of parent cells. ''clcA'' knockouts have defects in [/ontology/go/0048268/annotation/page/1 clathrin cage assembly], in [/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development], [/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis], and [/ontology/go/0009992/annotation/page/1 cellular water homeostasis] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14617352 Wang et al. 2003]).<br />Deletion analysis of the Clc protein has shown that the carboxyl terminus, which is highly conserved across different organisms, can rescue the cytokinesis and the developmental defects of ''clc'' null cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16734666 Wang et al. 2006]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-AUG-2004 PG

DDB_G0282819	Pascale Gaudet	Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) is a bioactive lipid that plays a role in diverse biological processes, including cell proliferation, cell death, cell movement and chemotaxis. In animal cells, it functions both as an extracellular ligand, and intracellularly as a second messenger. ''sglA'', the ''Dictyostelium'' gene encoding sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase, was isolated as a REMI mutant having increased resistance to cisplatin. The mutant produces short fruiting bodies with a thick stalk and a drastically reduced number of spores ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10974109 Li et al. 2000], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11566853 2001]). Null mutants in ''sglA'' have reduced [/ontology/go/0006935/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis] rates towards cAMP and decreased ability to repress lateral pseudopod formation ([/ontology/go/0031276/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of lateral pseudopodium formation]). Interestingly, the defects in the S-1-P lyase null mutants are similar to those seen in mutants lacking the genes for [/gene/DDB_G0280039 myoA], [/gene/DDB_G0289117 myoB], and [/gene/DDB_G0277221 chcA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15476260 Kumar et al. 2004]).

DDB_G0291972	Pascale Gaudet	CulA is a member of the cullin family of proteins that function as scaffolds that, along with F-box/WD40-repeat-containing proteins, mediate the ubiquitination of proteins to target them for degradation by the proteasome ([/ontology/go/0004842/annotation/page/1 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity]). ''culA'' null cells are defective in inducing cell-type-specific gene expression and exhibit defects during aggregation, including reduced chemotaxis ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]), ([/ontology/go/0006935/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis]). <br />Overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit ([/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC]) rescues many of the ''culA'' null defects, as well as those of cells lacking [/gene/DDB_G0276887 fbxA], a F-box/WD40-repeat-containing protein, Whereas [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] protein levels drop as the multicellular organism forms in the wild-type strain, they remain high in ''culA'' null and ''fbxA'' null cells. CulA, FbxA, and RegA are found in a complex ''in vivo'' ([/ontology/go/0019005/annotation/page/1 SCF ubiquitin ligase complex]), and formation of this complex is dependent on the MAP kinase ERK2 ([/gene/DDB_G0283903 erkB]), which is also required for PKA function. This data suggest a model in which CulA and FbxA regulate multicellular development by targeting RegA for degradation via a pathway that requires ERK2 function, leading to an increase in cAMP and PKA activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390363  (Mohanty et al. 2001)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 3-JUN-2008 PF

DDB_G0286183	Pascale Gaudet	''agps'' is an oxidoreductase with [/ontology/go/0008609/annotation/page/1 alkylglycerone-phosphate synthase activity], responsible for the formation of alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate (alkyl-DHAP) through the exchange of the acyl moiety of acyl-DHAP with a fatty alcohol. This reaction required FAD. This essential reaction generates the ether bond in the [/ontology/go/0008611/annotation/page/1 ether lipid biosynthetic process]. In other organisms, this takes place in the [/ontology/go/0005777/annotation/page/1 peroxisome]. Consistent with this, the ''Dictyostelium'' protein has a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal at the C terminus.<br />The ''Dictyostelium'' Agps protein has been crystallized ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17562315 Razeto et al., 2007], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17601746 Razeto et al., 2007]). The catalytic site contains five conserved residues: Asp237, Arg352,Arg447, Glu461, and Tyr508. Mutagenesis of the Arg352 residue diminishes agps activity, while mutation of Tyr508 abolishes the activity. <br />Defects in human ''AGPS'' causes rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), a peroxisomal disorder defined by the inability of patients to synthesize ether phospholipids. This results in serious developmental defects and death before 10 years of age. <br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-DEC-2007 PG

Seventeen of these genes encode identical proteins: [/gene/DDB_G0289553 act1], [/gene/DDB_G0274133 act2], [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8], [/gene/DDB_G0274601 act9], [/gene/DDB_G0288879 act11], [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12], [/gene/DDB_G0274599 act13], [/gene/DDB_G0274137 act14], [/gene/DDB_G0272520 act15], [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16], [/gene/DDB_G0274727 act19], [/gene/DDB_G0274285 act20], and [/gene/DDB_G0274561 act21], while [/gene/DDB_G0289811 act10], [/gene/DDB_G0275023 act22], and [/gene/DDB_G0289487 act3] respectively have 1, 4 and 11 amino acid differences compared to the 17 identical genes. The proteins encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0274131 act17], [/gene/DDB_G0289489 act18], [/gene/DDB_G0268744 act23] and [/gene/DDB_G0289505 act24]are more divergent. <br />Actin is a major [/ontology/go/0005200/annotation/page/1 structural constituent of cytoskeleton]. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in ''Dictyostelium'', constituting approximately 8% of the total protein in vegetative cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/561722 Alton and Lodish et al. 1977]).Actin synthesis is developmentally regulated, peaking shortly after starvation (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894564 Firtel] in 1981). The different actin genes differ in their levels of expression, with [/gene/DDB_G0274135 act6], [/gene/DDB_G0269234 act8] and [/gene/DDB_G0274129 act12] being highly expressed both during growth and development compared to [/gene/DDB_G0289005 act4], [/gene/DDB_G0289663 act5], [/gene/DDB_G0280545 act7] and [/gene/DDB_G0272248 act16] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286214 McKeown and Firtel 1981]).

DDB_G0277589	Pascale Gaudet	''gtaC'' was identified as a DIF-1 insensitive mutant, dimC, that fail to make stalk cells in response to DIF in the 8-Br-cAMP monolayer assay. ''gtaC'' is expressed in the lower and upper cups and the basal disc;, and consistent with that pattern of expression, mutant phenotypes show that it is involved in DIF signaling leading to pstB cell sorting and basal disc formation.<br />''gtaC'' is maximally expressed during aggregation, and localizes to the nucleus upon DIF stimulation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22008230 Keller and Thompson 2008]). <br />GATA transcription factors specifically bind the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory regions of genes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2249770 Yamamoto et al. 1990]).In mammalian cells, GATA-binding transcription factors play important roles in development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12943715 Tremblay and Viger 2003]). In ''Dictyostelium'', there are 24 predicted proteins that contain GATA-type zinc fingers: [/gene/DDB_G0277147 stkA], [/gene/DDB_G0280547 comH], [/gene/DDB_G0277589 gtaC], [/gene/DDB_G0286855 gtaD],[/gene/DDB_G0267640 gtaE],[/gene/DDB_G0268792 gtaF],[/gene/DDB_G0270756 gtaG],[/gene/DDB_G0277591 gtaH],[/gene/DDB_G0281661 gtaI],[/gene/DDB_G0281829 gtaJ],[/gene/DDB_G0282811 gtaK],[/gene/DDB_G0285139 gtaL],[/gene/DDB_G0286837 gtaM],[/gene/DDB_G0287057 gtaN],[/gene/DDB_G0289651 gtaO],[/gene/DDB_G0295707 gtaP],[/gene/DDB_G0286843 gtaQ],[/gene/DDB_G0279331 gtaR],[/gene/DDB_G0280627 gtaS],[/gene/DDB_G0280639 gtaT],[/gene/DDB_G0280853 gtaU],[/gene/DDB_G0281087 gtaV],[/gene/DDB_G0286839 gtaW], and[/gene/DDB_G0290665 gtaX].

DDB_G0276353	Pascale Gaudet	The TorA protein is a novel protein with predicted coiled-coil motif near its carboxy terminus. The protein is localized to large clusters at one end of the [/ontology/go/0005739/annotation/page/1 mitochondrion]. <br />''torA'' was isolated during a REMI mutant screen for genes required for chemotaxis. The mutant forms small plaques on bacteria due to defects in [/ontology/go/0043327/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis to cAMP], but it exhibits normal phagocytosis and detection of cAMP. The defects caused by mutations in ''torA'' are rescued by expression of [/gene/DDB_G0269152 mekA]. Overexpression of ''torA'' leads to surface-dependent growth: cells are unable to grow is suspension ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11157987 van Es et al. 2001]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 14-SEP-2005 PG
DDB_G0289541	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium vasP'' was isolated by a PCR approach based on its similarity to VASP (vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein) in other organisms [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388544  (Han et al. 2002)]. Ena/VASP proteins are a conserved family of actin regulatory proteins containing EVH1 and EVH2 (Ena/Vasp Homology 1 or 2) domains, and a proline-rich central region (PRD) (for review see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14570581  (Krause et al. 2003)].<br />To elucidate the role of VASP further, ''vasP'' was deleted in ''Dictyostelium''. The ''vasP''-null mutants showed normal growth and development. However, individual cells were about 40% smaller and showed and F-actin organization ([/ontology/go/0007015/annotation/page/1 actin filament organization])different from wildtype, concentrated in a few small regions around the periphery. In addition, cell surfaces were smooth with no actin-containing, filopodia-like membrane protrusions ([/ontology/go/0046847/annotation/page/1 filopodium formation]). In a chemotactic gradient, the mutant showed a decrease in the suppression of lateral pseudopods, and 50% of the cells lifted from the substrate and remained elevated for up to one minute. This resulted in a decrease in [/ontology/go/0031589/annotation/page/1 cell-substrate adhesion] during migration, and in a reduced chemotaxis rate ([/ontology/go/0050922/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of chemotaxis]).<br />VASP overexpressing cells showed an increased number of filopodia and a higher F-actin level. These effects were even magnified in a mutant that expressed ''vasP'' with a myristoylation tag, which directs the protein to the membrane. Although the overall expression level of this myr-tagged protein was lower than that in the overexpressor, filopodium number and F-actin content were further increased, suggesting that membrane-bound VASP is responsible for filopodium formation. Increased F-actin level and filopodium formation were also observed in a null mutant overexpressing just the PRD-EVH2 domains. Overexpression of other domain combinations showed that it is the EVH2 domain that is responsible for these effects. Furthermore, ''in vitro'' analyses showed that the EVH2 domain is essential for [/ontology/go/0030041/annotation/page/1 actin filament polymerization].<br />GFP-tagged VASP rescued the null phenotype. In vegetative cells, VASP was found in the ([/ontology/go/0005829/annotation/page/1 cytosol]), although strong staining was observed in filopodia ([/ontology/go/0030175/annotation/page/1 filopodium]). In response to cAMP stimulation VASP translocates to the [/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex], enriched at the [/ontology/go/0031252/annotation/page/1 leading edge]; this process depends on the EVH2 domain. In sum, ''Dictyostelium vasP'' plays a role in controlling the actin cytoskeleton during chemotaxis and filopodium formation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388544  (Han et al. 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 07-SEP-2004 PF

DDB_G0277221	Pascale Gaudet	Clathrin is part of the vesicles coat ([/ontology/go/0030118/annotation/page/1 clathrin coat]) involved in endocytosis from the plasma membrane, as well as traffic from endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. The clathrin protein is composed of three 190-kDa heavy chains (encoded by ''chcA'') and three ~30-kDa light chains ([/gene/DDB_G0277403 clc]) that form the clathrin triskelion.<br />The ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin heavy chain sequence has 57% identity with the mammalian protein. mRNA levels are highest during vegetative growth and decline as the cells progress through development. The concentration of clathrin heavy-chain protein is the same in cells grown in liquid media (high rates of pinocytosis) as in cells grown with bacteria([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1605855 O'Halloran and Anderson 1992]). GFP-clathrin distribute into punctate loci found throughout the cytoplasm, on the plasma membrane, and concentrated to a perinuclear location([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10848635 Damer and O'Halloran 2000]). ''chcA'' null mutants have reduced pinocytosis and defective processing and localization of lysosomal protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8034739 Ruscetti et al. 1994]).In addition, these mutants display about 40% of the level of extracellular cyclic AMP binding normally found in wild-type cellsAggregation is delayed, and the fruiting bodies have an irregular shape. ''chcA''- cells failed to sort correctly and never produced functional spores([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9053320 Niswonger and O'Halloran 1997]). ''chcA''- cells have defective cytokinesis in suspension that result from their inability to assemble myosin II into a functional contractile ring ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9238018 Niswonger and O'Halloran 1997], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11223952 Gerald et al. 2001]). Study of cell motility using the ''chcA'' muatnt suggests that clathrin suppresses pseudopod formation and stabilizes the uropod in the posterior half of a crawling cell ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10591622 Wessel et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 30-AUG-2004 PG
DDB_G0274387	Pascale Gaudet	''Dictyostelium'' development is sensitive to Li+ treatment. Mutants that lack the ''dpoA'' gene, encoding a prolyl oligopeptidase, are able to develop in the presence of Li+. Prolyl oligopeptidases [EC 3.4.21.26] are endopeptidases that cleave Pro-X amino acid bonds on small polypeptides ([/ontology/go/0006508/annotation/page/1 proteolysis]), ([/ontology/go/0004287/annotation/page/1 prolyl oligopeptidase activity]). Inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP3) levels, known to be affected by Li+, are increased in the ''dpoA'' mutant ([/ontology/go/0009966/annotation/page/1 regulation of signal transduction]). IP3 concentrations increase via an unconventional mechanism that involves enhanced dephosphorylation of inositol (1,3,4,5,6) pentakisphosphate. Loss of DpoA activity therefore counteracts the reduction in IP3 concentration caused by Li+ treatment. No genetic interaction was observed with [/gene/DDB_G0272110 gskA], another major cellular target of Li+ ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10329620 Williams et al. 1999]).

DDB_G0277399	Pascale Gaudet	Pianissimo, encoded by the ''piaA'' gene, was identified as a mutant unable to aggregate on bacterial lawns ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). PiaA is a 130-kD cytosolic protein required for [/ontology/go/0006935/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis] and [/ontology/go/0045762/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of adenylate cyclase activity] ([/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389653 Chen et al. 1997]).<br />The HSB1 mutant harbors a point mutation in the ''piaA'' gene, G917D, that causes a temperature-sensitive developmental phenotype: these cells can undergo aggregation and fruiting body formation at temperatures below 18 degrees C but not above. ''in vivo'' HSB1 mutants have defective G protein-linked adenylyl cyclase activation; transfection with the ''piaA'' but not [/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA] gene rescues the mutant.

DDB_G0272837	Pascale Gaudet	''ifkA'' and [/gene/DDB_G0276829 ifkB] encode homologs of a kinase that phosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha ([/ontology/go/0004686/annotation/page/1 elongation factor-2 kinase activity]), ([/ontology/go/0006445/annotation/page/1 regulation of translation]). The two Ifk proteins possess all of the hallmarks of typical GCN2 proteins, including the characteristic kinase domain and the HisRS domain. ''ifkA'' is expressed during growth and drops dramatically soon after the onset of development. <br />Disruption of the ''ifkA'' gene causes defects in early development. ''ifkA'' null cells aggregate earlier than parental cells due to a more rapid establishment of the cAMP pulsing system. Cells lacking a functional IfkA protein form larger mounds and subsequent developmental structures ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]), ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]). This defect was linked to a reduced extracellular level of Countin ([/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA]).

S-[/ontology/go/0004013/annotation/page/1 adenosylhomocysteinase activity] was first characterized in ''Dictyostelium'' in a [/ontology/go/0030552/annotation/page/1 cAMP binding] protein with a molecular weight of 47 kilodaltons that likely exists as a 190 kilodaltontetramer ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6299402 Gunzburg et al. 1983]). The ''sahA'' gene was later identifiedand cloned, and its amino acid sequence is highly conserved with mammalian SAHH ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3288206 Kasir etal. 1988], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3139100 Guitton et al. 1988]). The biochemistry of SahAhas been extensively studied and has been shown to be activated by bound NAD+ and reversibly inactivated by cAMP andthe adenosine analog 2'-deoxyadenosine ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6319183 Hohman and Veron 1984], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6091559 Hohman et al. 1984]). Inactivation of the SahA protein by cAMP occurs via dissociationof SahA from NAD+, however, inactivation by 2'-deoxyadenosine is through the reduction of bound NAD+ to NADH ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2991881 Hohman et al. 1985]).<br />Cellular localization of SahA has been observed in the [/ontology/go/0005737/annotation/page/1 cytoplasm], in the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus], and in the [/ontology/go/0005938/annotation/page/1 cell cortex] of vegetative amoeba ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15358428 Yamada and Sameshima 2004]) and in the [/ontology/go/0031252/annotation/page/1 leading edge] of chemotaxing cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17172447 Shu et al. 2006]).

RasC has a single amino acid substitution in its effector domain (D38N), and several differences in the effector-proximal domain (believed to play a role in activation of target proteins), suggesting that it has unique functions ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8290260 Daniel et al. 1993]).

RasC is expressed throughout the life cycle and its expression is enriched in the prestalk cell population. ''rasC'' null cells are incapable of [/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]. This defect is rescued by the application of exogenous cAMP pulses. ''rasC''- cells do not produce cAMP in response to 2'-deoxy-cAMP, indicating that RasC is involved in [/ontology/go/0045762/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of adenylate cyclase activity] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500376 Lim et al. 2001]).

DDB_G0292266	Pascale Gaudet	''amdA'' encodes AMP deaminase which functions in the interconversion of purines ([/ontology/go/0003876/annotation/page/1 AMP deaminase activity]), ([/ontology/go/0009167/annotation/page/1 purine ribonucleoside monophosphate metabolic process]). ''amdA'' is contitutively expressed in ''Dictyostelium''. Disruption of the ''amdA'' gene results in short, thick stalks and glassy sori with less than 5% the normal number of spores, indicating a defect in [/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation]. These cell also have a significantly increased proportion of prestalk cells of the pstA type. This alteration in cell-type proportioning is a cell-autonomous consequence of the loss of AMP deaminase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11784104 Chae et al. 2002]).<br />A recently characterized ''Dictyostelium'' cell type, the aspidocyte, is highly resistant to detergents and develops in the presence of a number of toxic chemicals, including heavy metals, inhibitors of sterol, protein or RNA synthesis and of mitosis. ''amdA''- cells form aspidocyte more readily than wild type cells. Since ''amdA''- cells have higher AMP levels compared to wild type cells, this could be a signal for aspidocyte differentiation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17259634 Serafimidis et al. 2007]).

In their N-terminal half, copines contain two Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding domains (C2 domains) present in such proteins as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Much of the C-terminal half consists of a von Willebrand Factor type A domain (VWFA) typically found in the extracellular portions of membrane proteins like integrins. Thus copines represent a fusion of intracellular (C2) and extracellular (VWFA) domains. However, there are no signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane sequences in the predicted proteins suggesting copines are intracellular proteins. Copines are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking. It is of particular interest that copines, first found in the highly phagocytic protozoan ''Paramecium'' and then isolated from mammalian spleen and liver, seem to be abundant in cells and organs that are, or contain, phagocytes. In this context it comes as no surprise that phagocytic ''Dictyostelium'' has a total of six copine genes[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343335  (Damer et al. 2005)].

DDB_G0271916	Pascale Gaudet	''rtoA'' was initially isolated by shotgun antisense cDNA as a gene required for [/ontology/go/0030587/annotation/page/1 sorocarp development] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8643519 Spann et al., 1996]). Defects in ''rtoA'' results in cells that have an abnormally high percentage of prestalk cells. Unlike wild type cells, ''rtoA'' mutant cells' propensity to differentate into prestalk or prespore cells is independent of their position in the cell cycle at starvation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8951083 Wood et al., 1996]). RtoA levels vary during the cell cycle. During development, expression of RtoA is restricted to prespore cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10747962 Brazill et al., 2000]). ''rtoA''- cells have aberrant regulation of calcium levels during the cell cycle, indicating that [/ontology/go/0006874/annotation/page/1 cellular calcium ion homeostasis] may be linked to the [/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11330860 Azhar et al., 2001]). The ''rtoA''- mutation affects the [/ontology/go/0006885/annotation/page/1 regulation of pH] in the cytosol as well as in the endocytic and exocytic vesicles. The RtoA protein contains several repeats of a serine-rich motif, which catalyzes the fusion of phospholipid vesicles ''in vitro''. Consistent with a role in [/ontology/go/0006944/annotation/page/1 membrane fusion], ''rtoA''- cells have a defect in the fusion of endocytic vesicles and decreased [/ontology/go/0006887/annotation/page/1 exocytosis] rates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10747962 Brazill et al., 2000]).<br />Partial uppression of the ''rtoA'' phenotype can be observed in an insertional mutant that disrupts both [/gene/DDB_G0275689 abcG2] and [/gene/DDB_G0275687 abcG18] (''mdrA1/mdrA2''). The triple null ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' has greatly reduced endocytosis rates. Also, the cytosolic and endosomal pH of ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' are abnormal, indicating that the product of these genes are required for proper [/ontology/go/0048388/annotation/page/1 endosomal lumen acidification] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11719559 Brazill et al., 2001]).<br />''rtoA''- cells are more resistant to infection by the pathogen ''Legionella pneumophila'', probably because due to their defect in endocytic vesicles fusion ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15679845 Li et al., 2005]). It is also less efficient at phagocytosing the fungus ''Cryptococcus neoformans'', although once ingested, ''C. neoformans'' replicates as well in ''rtoA-'' mutants as in wild type cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12933827 Steenbergen et al., 2001]).<br />A region of the ''rtoA'' promoter necessary for the response to osmotic stress have been identified (Tsujioka and Williams 2007, personnal communication to dictyBase; the complete communication is available on the '''rtoA Community Annotation Page''', see link just above the Summary). The region between -144 and 256 relative to the start codon of the Curated Model is essential for up-regulation of ''rtoA'' following exposure to 100 mM sorbitol.

DDB_G0277859	Petra Fey	The ''mlcE'' gene codes for the essential myosin light chain (ELC) of myosin II. Antisense or mlcE-null mutants resemble [/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA] mutants. They grow poorly in suspension and become large and multinucleate. Despite the cytokinesis ([/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis]) defect myosin localizaion in the cells was shown to be normal. While mlcE- cells are able to respond to chemoattractant with proper directionality, their rate of movement is reduced ([/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motility]). Aggregation is delayed, and only 50 % of the aggregates progress further to form shorter fruiting bodies with thicker stalks ([/ontology/go/0030587/annotation/page/1 sorocarp development]). Studies using lacZ reporter constructs expressed from cell type specific promoters showed the localization of prespore cells is more susceptible to the loss of ELC ([/ontology/go/0016477/annotation/page/1 cell migration]) than prestalk cells. In myosin purified from the mlcE- cells the actin-activated ATPase activity ([/ontology/go/0030898/annotation/page/1 actin-dependent ATPase activity]) was greatly reduced. This result and the proper localization of myosin in mlcE- cells suggest that its phenotypic defects primarily arise from defective contractile function of myosin rather than its mislocalization [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1535025  (Pollenz et al. 1992)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7593282  (Chen et al. 1995)]. <br />Deletion mutations showed that both the amino and carboxyl termini of the ELC are required for binding to the myosin heavy chain (MHC). When these mutants were analyzed for their ability to complement the cytokinesis defect displayed by mlcE- cells, a correlation to the level of ELC carried by the MHC was observed, indicating that a stoichiometric ELC-MHC association is necessary for normal myosin function in vivo [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7499275  (Ho et al. 1995)]. The ELC wraps around an alpha-helix that extends from the myosin head, where it is believed to play a structural support role. However, substitution mutations of charged residues in loops I, II, III, and helix G of the ELC lead to reduced actin-activated ATPase activity despite stoichiometric binding to the heavy chain. This result suggests that the ELC contributes to myosin's enzymatic activity in addition to providing structural support for the alpha-helical neck region of MHC [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9020178  (Ho et al. 1997)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PF
DDB_G0281899	Petra Fey	The ''drkC'' gene encodes the receptor-like tyrosine kinase VSK3 ([/ontology/go/0004713/annotation/page/1 protein-tyrosine kinase activity]) that is involved in [/ontology/go/0006909/annotation/page/1 phagocytosis]. Gene expression peaks in vegetative cells (0 to 2 hours), which coincides with the time cells feed by endocytosis. VSK3 null mutants showed defects in the fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes ([/ontology/go/0001845/annotation/page/1 phagolysosome formation]). In addition, VSK3 is located in the late [/ontology/go/0030670/annotation/page/1 phagocytic vesicle membrane]. It has been shown that the N-terminus of the protein is located inside the vesicle, whereas the C-terminal kinase domain resides in the cytoplasm where ATP is abundant for [/ontology/go/0005524/annotation/page/1 ATP binding]. ''Dictyostelium'' contains two more genes ([/gene/DDB_G0289791 drkA], [/gene/DDB_G0289709 drkB]) that encode putative receptor kinases with an N-terminal signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17664333  (Fang et al. 2007)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-AUG-2007 PF

DDB_G0293532	Pascale Gaudet	''Dictyostelium'' is the simplest organism known to employ STAT signaling. STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are characterized by a DNA binding domain, an SH2 domain, and a site of tyrosine phosphorylation. A STAT becomes activated when a ligand binds to its receptor, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the monomeric STAT molecule. Four STATs have been identified in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA], [/gene/DDB_G0268638 dstB], [/gene/DDB_G0293532 dstC] and [/gene/DDB_G0275167 dstD]. <br />STATc was isolated by low stringency hybridization using the SH2 domain of STATa as a probe. Upon exposure to DIF, the inducer of pstO cell differentiation, STATc becomes phosphorylated at Y922, dimerizes, and accumulates in the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus] of pstO cells. Detailed mutational analysis of the STATc protein has shown that the 46 N-terminal amino acidsare sufficient for nuclear localization, while residues 505 to 554 are required for export outside the nucleus. Phosphorylation and dimerization possibly masks the export sequence and favors the nuclear accumulation of STATs ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12506009 Fukuzawa et al. 2003]). <br />The ''dstC'' null mutant develops precociously ([/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development]). The mutant continues migrationunder conditions that favor culmination of parental slugs. The [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA] gene, which is normally only expressed in pstA cells, is expressed in pstA as well as pstO cells in the mutant([/ontology/go/0016564/annotation/page/1 transcription repressor activity]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11336701 Fukuzawa et al. 2001]). <br />The [/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response], [/ontology/go/0009408/annotation/page/1 response to heat] and [/ontology/go/0006979/annotation/page/1 response to oxidative stress] all involve STATc activation through phosphorylation and nuclear localization. Mutants have been analyzed to identify the signaling pathway leading to STATc activation in response to osmotic stress. The response is independent of the [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC], [/gene/DDB_G0274101 dokA], [/gene/DDB_G0276269 sgcA] and [/gene/DDB_G0275009 gca] genes.

DDB_G0284601	Petra Fey	CK2 (casein kinase II), a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase, is one of the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells. The protein kinase usually forms a tetramer, comprised of two catalytic alpha or alpha' subunits, and two regulatory beta subunits. The ''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0276885 casK] gene encodes a previously cloned CK2 alpha chain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448100  (Kikkawa et al., 1992)]. In addition, the ''Dictyostelium'' genome contains another putative alpha chain [/gene/DDB_G0286481 DDB_G0286481], and a single ortholog of the CK2 beta chain, ''csnk2b''. <br />The CK2 alpha chain encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0276885 casK] has been identified by PCR, based on similarity. Northern blot analysis of [/gene/DDB_G0276885 casK] during development, as well as CK2 activity ([/ontology/go/0004682/annotation/page/1 protein kinase CK2 activity]) throughout development both show a constitutive expression and presence of CK2 during the ''Dictyostelium'' life cycle. Attempts to delete the ''casK'' gene failed, indicating that it is an essential gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448100  (Kikkawa et al., 1992)]. However, in yeast, which has two CK2 genes, only (haploid) cells carrying disruptions in both CK2 alpha chains are inviable [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2196445  (Padmanabha et al., 1990)].<br />Protein kinase CK2 represents a family of closely related kinases with broad specifity. There are hundreds of target molecules, implicating CK2 in many signalling pathways ([/ontology/go/0007165/annotation/page/1 signal transduction]), including such involved in cell survival. For recent reviews see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396231  (Litchfield, 2003)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12631575  (Meggio &amp; Pinnal, 2003)], and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062170  (Ahmed et al., 2002)]. <br />The presence of a second putative CK2 alpha- and one putative CK2 beta chain in ''Dictyostelium'' suggests that the tetrameric holoenzyme in this organism consists of two different alpha chains and two identical beta chains. However, currently there is no eperimental evidence that these putative genes are expressed and further investigation is necessary.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2004 PF

DDB_G0273995	Petra Fey	The ''icmA'' gene encodes the conserved isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase in ''Dictyostelium''. The protein was shown to have [/ontology/go/0004671/annotation/page/1 protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase activity]. The ''icmA''-null mutant shows defects in early development, such as no cell polarization ([/ontology/go/0030010/annotation/page/1 establishment of cell polarity]) or streaming, aberrant cAMP wave formation, and in some cases loose mound formation that may proceed to form aberrant fruiting bodies ([/ontology/go/0060176/annotation/page/1 regulation of aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). In the mutant, the starvation-induced expression of the cAMP receptor [/gene/DDB_G0273397 carA-1] is delayed, also reflected in the fact that mutant membranes bind only 34% of the CAMP that wild-type membranes bind. However, in pulsed mutant cells the cAMP relay response is 3 times larger than in wild type. In addition, Ras GTPase ([/gene/DDB_G0293434 rasG]) has been shown to be methylated and in the ''icmA''-null mutant RasG, as well as CRAC ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) are mislocalized in cAMP-pulsed cells. In sum, these data show that isoprenylcysteine methylation is required for signalling in response to cAMP ([/ontology/go/0008277/annotation/page/1 regulation of G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway]) and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699599 Chen et al. 2007)].

DDB_G0277671	Pascale Gaudet	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates ([/ontology/go/0003899/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity]). Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase III is a multisubunit complex. The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPO31''), [/gene/DDB_G0293560 rpa2] (''RPC2''), [/gene/DDB_G0268080 rpc3] (''RPC82''),[/gene/DDB_G0277671 rpc4] (''RPC53''), [/gene/DDB_G0271514 rpc5] (''RPC37''), [/gene/DDB_G0286521 rpc9] (''RPC17''), [/gene/DDB_G0272022 rpc34] (''RPC34''), [/gene/DDB_G0273425 rpc25-1] (''RPC25''), and [/gene/DDB_G0287707 rpc11] (''RPC11'') are unique to RNA polymerase III. Orthologs of ''RPC31'' and ''RPC17'' have not been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II. Subunits [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], and [/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12] are common to all three RNA polymerases ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12407181 Peyroche et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381659 Schramm and Hernandez 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-JUN-2009 PG

DDB_G0285433	Pascale Gaudet	In mammalian cells, phosducin binds to G proteins and modulate their activity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there are three groups of phodsucin proteins. ''Dictyostelium'', like mammalian cells and ''Drosophila'', has one member from each group: [/gene/DDB_G0292850 phlp1], [/gene/DDB_G0285433 phlp2], and [/gene/DDB_G0293848 phlp3]. Phosducins consist of an N-terminal domain containing three helices which binds the alpha subunit of G proteins, and a C-terminal domain which bears similarity to thioredoxin and binds to the beta/gamma subunit of G proteins. <br />Phlp2 lack many residues in the C-terminal region that are expected to be required for G beta/gamma binding. The cellular role of Phlp2 is unknown, but appears to be essential for growth: null mutants divide for a few generations and die. The putative ortholog from ''S. cerevisiae'', ''plp2'', is also essential ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/199357 Blaauw et al.2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-JUN-2008 PG
DDB_G0283389	Pascale Gaudet	Rhesus proteins (Rh) are glycoproteins present on the cell surface of red blood cells in mammals and are involved in ammonium ion export ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12846905 Hemker et al., 2003]). <br />''Dictyostelium'' has two genes encoding proteins with significant similarity to Rh proteins, [/gene/DDB_G0283389 rhgA] and [/gene/DDB_G0280059 rhgB]. RhgA is localized to the [/ontology/go/0000331/annotation/page/1 contractile vacuole], suggesting a role in osmoregulation. However, analysis of a null mutant has not revealed any defect is the response to osmotic stress ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11220631 Benghezal et al., 2001]).

DDB_G0277889	Karen Kestin	Ammonia signaling is essential to the developmental program of ''Dictyostelium''. It is involved in regulatingchemotaxis, the choice between slug migration and culmination, and cell-type specification via differential geneexpression. Ammonia concentrations are regulated in part by environmental factors, however, cellular processes such astransport ([/ontology/go/0008519/annotation/page/1 ammonium transmembrane transporter activity]) and metabolism can alter intracellular concentrations. In the ''Dictyostelium'' proteome,three putative ammonium transporters exist: [/gene/DDB_G0277503 amtA], [/gene/DDB_G0277889 amtB], and [/gene/DDB_G0267424 amtC]. The transcriptlevels of the three ''amt'' genes are constant throughout development, however, their spatial expression patterns, asdetermined by ''in situ'' hybridization, are both distinct and complementary. The ''amtA'' gene is generallyexpressed in the prestalk regions, although it is also found in the upper and lower cups of the sorus and in regionscontacting the substratum. The ''amtB'' transcript is observed primarily in prepore regions and in the spore region ofthe sorus, but is absent from the upper and lower cups. Expression of ''amtC'' is similar to that of ''amtB'', however, it appears transiently in the anterior tip during the first finger stage. Disruption of the ''amtC'' gene results in larger multicelluar structures and developmental arrest at the slug stage, although a smallpercentage of slugs are able to fruit after 40+ hours of starvation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14686953 Follstaedt et al.2003]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-AUG-2008 PG

DDB_G0277147	Pascale Gaudet	''stkA'' has been isolated as a "stalky" mutant, in which cells destined to become spores end up as stalk cells ([/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation]).The ''stkA'' gene contains GATA-binding transcription factor domains. Its transcript appears at approximately 10 hr of development and peaks at 16-18 hr, preferentially in prespore cells. The StkA protein contains two sequences necessary for localization to the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8898200 Chang et al. 1996]). <br />Putative targets for this factor have been identified by differential display of RNA from cells of the culmination stage. In ''stkA'' null mutants, the genes [/gene/DDB_G0277835 cspA], [/gene/DDB_G0292808 cspB], [/gene/DDB_G0282293 rnpA], and [/gene/DDB_G0293364 sigB] fail to be expressed ([/ontology/go/0003700/annotation/page/1 transcription factor activity]), ([/ontology/go/0006355/annotation/page/1 regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11100898 Loughran et al. 2000]). The promoters of ''sigB'' and ''culD'' are also regulated by the MADS box transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14665466 Escalante et al. 2003]). <br />GATA transcription factors specifically bind the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory regions of genes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2249770 Yamamoto et al. 1990]).In mammalian cells, GATA-binding transcription factors play important roles in development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12943715 Tremblay and Viger 2003]).

DDB_G0274455	CGM_DDB	Mutants of the ''myoI'' gene have a defect in [/ontology/go/0006909/annotation/page/1 phagocytosis], [/ontology/go/0031589/annotation/page/1 cell-substrate adhesion], and [/ontology/go/0046847/annotation/page/1 filopodium formation].MyoI is located to the [/ontology/go/0005829/annotation/page/1 cytosol] and [/ontology/go/0030175/annotation/page/1 filopodium] tips in vegetative cells, to the [/ontology/go/0031252/annotation/page/1 leading edge] in migrating cells, and is transiently recruited to the [/ontology/go/0001891/annotation/page/1 phagocytic cup] during phagocytosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11267868 Tuxworth et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10574761 Titus 1999]). MyoI has been classified as a class VII myosin and proposed as a model for vertebrate MYO7A, which when mutated causes Usher's syndrome in human characterized by the occurence of retinitis pigmentosa and sensorineural deafness ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10574761 Titus 1999], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10574757 Hasson 1999]). However , ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16857047 Kollmar 2006]) found in phylogenetic analysis that MyoI rather resembles a common ancestor of four myosin classes (VII, X, XV, and XXII).<br />A binding partner has been identified, TalinA ([/gene/DDB_G0290481 talA]),([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15826949 Tuxworth et al. 2005]), and later it has been found that TalinA and MyoI are associated with each other in the [/ontology/go/0005624/annotation/page/1 membrane fraction]. MyoI null cells exhibit an 80% decrease in TalinA levels. Increased MyoI levels resulted in concomitant increases in total TalinA, while changes in TalinA levels did not affect MyoI levels. It was further established that only small portions of the MyoI tail stabilize TalinA levels. However, restauration of TalinA levels alone did not rescue the phagocytosis defect of the null mutant, suggesting that the motor domain is necessary for this function. Photobleaching experiments showed that changes in the overall amounts of MyoI and TalinA influences the dynamics of membrane-associated MyoI ([/ontology/go/0005886/annotation/page/1 plasma membrane]). Taken together these results indicate that MyoI stabilizes TalinA in the cytosol and TalinA in turn regulates the location of MyoI at the plasma membrane ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17671169 Galdeen et al. 2007]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 24-JUN-2008 PF

DDB_G0277503	Pascale Gaudet	Ammonia signaling is essential to the developmental program of ''Dictyostelium''. It is involved in regulatingchemotaxis, the choice between slug migration and culmination, and cell-type specification via differential geneexpression. Ammonia concentrations are regulated in part by environmental factors, however, cellular processes such astransport ([/ontology/go/0008519/annotation/page/1 ammonium transmembrane transporter activity]) and metabolism can alter intracellular concentrations. In the ''Dictyostelium'' proteome, three putative ammonium transporters exist: [/gene/DDB_G0277503 amtA], [/gene/DDB_G0277889 amtB], and [/gene/DDB_G0267424 amtC]. The transcript levels of the three ''amt'' genes are constant throughout development, as determined by RT-PCR ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14686953 Follstaedt et al. 2003]); however, by Northern blot, another group has found the ''amtA'' gene to be strongly expressed until after the post-aggregation stage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951519 Yoshino et al.2007]). Discrepancies were also found in the spatial expression pattern: Follstaedt ''et al.'' localized ''amtA'' to the prestalk cells using ''in situ'' hybridization; while cell separation followed by Northern blotting showed an enrichment in prespore cells (Yoshino ''et al.''). The ''amtB'' transcript is observed primarily in prepore regions and in the spore region of the sorus, but is absent from the upper and lower cups. Expression of ''amtC'' is similar to that of '' amtB'', however, it appears transiently in the anterior tip during the first finger stage. Disruption of the '' amtC'' gene results in larger multicelluar structures and developmental arrest at the slug stage, although a small percentage of slugs are able to fruit after 40+ hours of starvation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14686953 Follstaedt et al.2003]).<br />The ''amtA'' null mutant forms small aggregates and small fruiting bodies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14686953 Follstaedt et al.2003], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951519 Yoshino et al.2007]). In addition, the mutant has increased intracellular ammonium levels and reduced extracellular ammonium levels, indicating a role for AmtA in ammonium export. This defect in ammonium homeostasis is also associated with decreased spore viability ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951519 Yoshino et al. 2007]).

DDB_G0290009	CGM_DDB	Sepiapterin reductase (SR, EC: 1.1.1.153) participates in the biosynthesis of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a co-factor for aromatic aminoacid hydroxylation, nitric oxide synthesis, and glyceryl-etherhydroxylation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10727395 Thony et al. 2000]). The first reaction in BH4 biosynthesis is catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I ([/gene/DDB_G0288481 gchA]), which converts GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2-NTP), which is transformed to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PPH4) by 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) ([/gene/DDB_G0279095 ptsA]). The diketo compound is reduced further to BH4 by SR through two consecutive reductions. <br />Cells in which ''sr'' has been knocked out still produce a small amount of pteridine (L-erythro-biopterin and D-threo-biopterin), possibly through a different pathway involving aldehyde reductase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21256841 Choi et al. 2005]). The mutant exhibits decreased growth rates, reduced spore viability, impaired mitochondrial function, and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The authors propose that tetrahydropterines have an antioxidant function in ''Dictyostelium'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17976377 Kim et al. 2007]).

DDB_G0271138	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export ([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]), ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and 11 ABCA family members: [/gene/DDB_G0291994 abcA1], [/gene/DDB_G0267438 abcA2], [/gene/DDB_G0293436 abcA3], [/gene/DDB_G0274121 abcA4], [/gene/DDB_G0274119 abcA5], [/gene/DDB_G0291245 abcA6], [/gene/DDB_G0271140 abcA7], [/gene/DDB_G0271138 abcA8],[/gene/DDB_G0291980 abcA9], [/gene/DDB_G0283387 abcA10], and [/gene/DDB_G0275453 abcA11],One of the defining characteristics of the A family is the presence of a regulatory domain with multiple sites for phosphorylation by various protein kinases in the region after the first ABC domain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

DDB_G0276885	Petra Fey	CK2 (casein kinase II), a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase, is one of the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells. The protein kinase usually forms a tetramer, comprised of two catalytic alpha or alpha' subunits, and two regulatory beta subunits. The ''Dictyostelium'' ''casK'' gene encodes a previously cloned CK2 alpha chain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448100  (Kikkawa et al., 1992)]. In addition, the ''Dictyostelium'' genome contains another putative alpha chain, [/gene/DDB_G0286481 DDB_G0286481], and a single ortholog of the CK2 beta chain, [/gene/DDB_G0284601 csnk2b]. <br />The CK2 alpha chain encoded by ''casK'' has been identified by PCR, based on similarity. Northern blot analysis of ''casK'' during development, as well as CK2 activity ([/ontology/go/0004682/annotation/page/1 protein kinase CK2 activity]) throughout development both show a constitutive expression and presence of CK2 during the ''Dictyostelium'' life cycle. Attempts to delete the ''casK'' gene failed, indicating that it is an essential gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448100  (Kikkawa et al., 1992)]. However, in yeast, which has two CK2 genes, only (haploid) cells carrying disruptions in both CK2 alpha chains are inviable [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2196445  (Padmanabha et al., 1990)].<br />Protein kinase CK2 represents a family of closely related kinases with broad specifity. There are hundreds of target molecules, implicating CK2 in many signalling pathways ([/ontology/go/0007165/annotation/page/1 signal transduction]), including such involved in cell survival. For recent reviews see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396231  (Litchfield, 2003)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12631575  (Meggio &amp; Pinnal, 2003)], and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062170  (Ahmed et al., 2002)]. <br />The presence of a second putative CK2 alpha- and one putative CK2 beta chain in ''Dictyostelium'' suggests that the tetrameric holoenzyme in this organism consists of two different alpha chains and two identical beta chains. However, currently there is no eperimental evidence that these putative genes are expressed and further investigation is necessary.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-MAY-2004 PF

DDB_G0279925	Petra Fey	The ''mlkA'' gene encodes the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK-A). The MLCK-A was purified, and found to phosphorylate ([/ontology/go/0004672/annotation/page/1 protein kinase activity]) the ''Dictyostelium'' RMLC (myosin regulatory light chain, [/gene/DDB_G0276077 mlcR]) with high specificity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3032987  (Griffith et al., 1987)]. RMLC phosphorylation occurs only on serine residues ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3029131  (Berlot et al., 1987)] and S13 has been identified as the phosphorylation site [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7806572  (Ostrow et al., 1994)]. <br />Despite the high sequence similarity of ''mlkA'' with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, including myosin light chain kinases from higher eukaryotes, it was shown that there is neither a calmodulin binding domain ([/ontology/go/0005516/annotation/page/1 calmodulin binding])in the ''mlkA'' sequence, nor calcium/camodulin-dependent activation ([/ontology/go/0004685/annotation/page/1 calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity]) of the kinase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1651931  (Tan &amp; Spudich, 1991)]. In fact, in ''Dictyostelium'' whole cell lysates as well as in ammonium sulfate fractions, no calcium/calmodulin-regulated MLCK-A activity was detected [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2380188  (Tan &amp; Spudich, 1990)]. However, two activation mechanisms of the MLCK-A have been identified: autophosphorylation at T289 ([/ontology/go/0046777/annotation/page/1 protein amino acid autophosphorylation]) in the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain, and phosphorylation in the activation loop at T166 by a yet unidentified kinase [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8947030  (Smith et al., 1996a)]. Although the Dictyostelium MLCK kinase has not been identified, rat calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase can be used as a surrogate activator of MLCK-A, phosphorylating it on Thr-166 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14570871  (Tokumitsu et al., 2004)]. Residues 283-288 function as an autoinhibitory sequence, and although autoinhibition is fully relieved by T166 phosphorylation, removal of the autoinhibitory domain alone does not generate maximum enzymatic activity. Thus phosphorylation of T166 by an upstream kinase releases autoinhibition and increases the catalytic activity of the MLCK-A.<br />Early studies found that cAMP stimulation ([/ontology/go/0019933/annotation/page/1 cAMP-mediated signaling]) increases RMLC phosphorylation due to a transient activitation of the MLCK-A [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3029131  (Berlot et al., 1987)]. Liu and Newell reported that the MLCK-A in cGMP-deficient mutant strains failed to phosphorylate the RMLC in response to cAMP, implicating cGMP in the regulation of MLCK-A activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7983143  (Liu &amp; Newell, 1996)]. More recently it was shown that MLCK-A activation through T166 phosphorylation is indirectly activated by cGMP ([/ontology/go/0019934/annotation/page/1 cGMP-mediated signaling]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9789030  (Silveira et al., 1998)].<br />A ''mlkA''-null mutant was generated, and, grown in suspension, showed a slight cytokinesis defect ([/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis]). The defect became more severe when cells were grown with heat-killed bacteria. However, the cytokinesis inefficiency is mild in comparison to [/gene/DDB_G0276077 mlcR] and [/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA] mutants. Also, different from those mutants, ''mlkA''-null cells were able to complete development. Because there is still phosphorylated RMLC present in ''mlkA''-null mutants, it has been suggested that there is at least one more kinase that phosphorylates the RMLC [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8901579  (Smith et al., 1996b)]. However, it has been shown that MLCK-A is the only kinase that is responsible for RMLC phosphorylation during chemotaxis ([/ontology/go/0050920/annotation/page/1 regulation of chemotaxis]), and that this process is activated by cGMP and [/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16546177  (Goldberg et al., 2006)].<br />MLCK-A is in the CAMK group of the protein kinase superfamily. It is 48-51% identical to four other putative ''Dictyostelium'' CAM kinases ([/gene/DDB_G0275057 DDB_G0275057], [/gene/DDB_G0271550 DDB_G0271550], [/gene/DDB_G0282429 DDB_G0282429], [/gene/DDB_G0292624 DDB_G0292624]). However, it is not known whether one or more of these kinases represents other MLCK(s), or if the other ''Dictyostelium'' MLCK enzyme(s) are more distantly related.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 09-FEB-2006 PF

DDB_G0278457	Petra Fey	The AGC family of serine/threonine protein kinases derives its name from the founding members: PKA (protein kinase A/cAMP-dependent protein kinase), PKG (protein kinase G), and PKC (protein kinase C). Other subfamilies exist within the AGC group, including Akt/PKB, NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related), PDK (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase), and RSK (ribosomal S6kinase). <br />There are 20 AGC family kinases in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome, among those are 4 NDR group kinases, two NDR-like kinases, [/gene/DDB_G0278457 ndrA], [/gene/DDB_G0288753 ndrB], and two LATS-related kinases [/gene/DDB_G0284839 ndrC], [/gene/DDB_G0289543 ndrD]. NdrA has been shown to be involved in phagocytosis, especially during the engulfment step. The protein localizes to the centrosome and during prometaphase to the spindle. In addition, several proteins have been identified to bind to NdrA: [/gene/DDB_G0278969 empC],[/gene/DDB_G0278907 mobA], and [/gene/DDB_G0292758 mobB] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21134080  (Kastner et al. 2011)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 14-JUN-2012 PF

DDB_G0269150	Pascale Gaudet	''lvsA'' was isolated as a mutant that has a large volume sphere phenotype. ''lvsA''- cells have a [/ontology/go/0000910/annotation/page/1 cytokinesis] defect similar to that of ''Dictyostelium'' clathrin heavy-chain mutants ([/gene/DDB_G0277221 chcA]) but less pronounced defects in[/ontology/go/0006907/annotation/page/1 pinocytosis] and [/ontology/go/0006909/annotation/page/1 phagocytosis].In addition, ''lvsA'' null mutant has defects in [/ontology/go/0007032/annotation/page/1 endosome organization], as does [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB] null mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10588668 Kwak et al. 1999], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11865029 Cornillon et al. 2002]). Localization studies have shown that GFP-LvsA is primarily associated with the membranes of the contractile vacuole system and that it has a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm. In ''lvsA'' mutants the contractile vacuole becomes disorganized and calmodulin ([/gene/DDB_G0279407 calA]) dissociates from the contractile vacuole membranes. Consequently, ''lvsA-'' mutants have an aberrant [/ontology/go/0006971/annotation/page/1 hypotonic response] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11872142 (Gerald et al. 2002)]. A truncated version of LvsA missing the 689 N-terminal amino acids rescues cytokinesis defects and partially rescues defects in osmoregulation of ''lvsA''- mutant. Further deletions resulted in the complete loss of LvsA function. The association of LvsA with the contractile vacuole is perturbed by the loss of [/gene/DDB_G0269130 phgA], a protein important for vacuole function. The exact function of LvsA is not known, but it has been shown to bind membranes ([/ontology/go/0005543/annotation/page/1 phospholipid binding])in a GTP-independent manner ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15086784 Wu et al. 2004]). <br />A double mutant in [/gene/DDB_G0280955 DDB_G0280955] and ''lvsA'' suppresses the large contractile vacuole phenotype of disgorgin-, while overexpression of GFP-lvsA enhances it, suggesting ''lvsA'' is involved in the organization of the contractile vacuole ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008]). <br />Seven BEACH domain-containing proteins have been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA], [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB], [/gene/DDB_G0280971 lvsC], [/gene/DDB_G0271502 lvsD], [/gene/DDB_G0282925 lvsE], [/gene/DDB_G0284333 lvsF], and [/gene/DDB_G0268088 lvsG].

DDB_G0271502	Pascale Gaudet	Seven BEACH domain-containing proteins have been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome: [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA], [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB], [/gene/DDB_G0280971 lvsC], [/gene/DDB_G0271502 lvsD], [/gene/DDB_G0282925 lvsE], [/gene/DDB_G0284333 lvsF], and [/gene/DDB_G0268088 lvsG]. <br />Disruption mutants were created in ''lvsA-F''. Phenotypic analyses of these mutants indicate LvsC-F proteins are not required for cytokinesis, osmoregulation (contrary to [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA]), lysosomal traffic (unlike [/gene/DDB_G0271504 lvsB]) or other processes such as growth and development ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3308452 Wang et al. 2002]). Howver, data from highthroughput analysis of mutants indicates that inertions in the ''lvsD'' gene causes aberrant cAMP wave formation, aberrant culmination, and aberrant vegetative growth ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17659086 Sawai et al. 2007])<br />A double mutant in [/gene/DDB_G0280955 DDB_G0280955] and ''lvsD'' enhances the large contractile vacuole phenotype of disgorgin-; whereas overexpression of GFP-lvsD suppresses it, suggesting ''lvsD'' is involved in the organization of the contractile vacuole. Since LvsD is cytosolic, it is possible that it interacts with [/gene/DDB_G0269150 lvsA] to inhibit its role in contractile vacuole organization([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636095 Du et al. 2008]).

DDB_G0279343	Karen Kestin	The Aurora family of serine/threonine protein kinases ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]) were originally identified in ''Drosophila melanogaster''mutants defective in spindle-pole behavior. The name "Aurora" stems from the auroraphenomenon observed in the night sky over the polar regions. Both Aurora A and Aurora B kinases have been found in metazoans, while only one Aurora kinase has been identified in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' and ''Dictyostelium discoideum''. Aurora A kinases associate with the centrosome during mitosis and have been shown to be involved in proper centrosome positioning and spindle assembly. Aurora B kinases are localized to the equator of the mitotic spindle and are thought to play a role in kinetochore attachment to the microtubule spindle and other important events in mitosis. <br />The ''Dictyostelium'' Aurora kinase has been shown to have properties of both Aurora A and Aurora B kinases. Like Aurora A, it localizes at to the [/ontology/go/0000922/annotation/page/1 spindle pole]s in early mitosis. Like Aurora B, it binds to [/gene/DDB_G0267690 icpA] (DdINCENP) and localizes to the [/ontology/go/0005813/annotation/page/1 centrosome], the [/ontology/go/0051233/annotation/page/1 spindle midzone], and the late [/ontology/go/0032154/annotation/page/1 cleavage furrow] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18326585 Li et al., 2008]).This gene has been comprehensively annotated, 12-NOV-2008 PF

DDB_G0282375	Pascale Gaudet	''amiB'' (aggregation minus B), was isolated as a REMI mutant that does not aggregate upon starvation ([/ontology/go/0031152/annotation/page/1 aggregation involved in sorocarp development]). ''amiB'' encodes the putative ortholog ofthe mediator complex subunit 13 med13 transcriptional co-activator involved in ([/ontology/go/0006367/annotation/page/1 transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter]). When starved, ''amiB''- cells fails to produce cAMP. Moreover, ''amiB''- cells do not turn off the expression of one of the growth-phase genes, [/gene/DDB_G0278721 cprD], and fail to turn on the expression of [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA] following starvation. The ectopic expression of [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA], [/gene/DDB_G0275445 mybB] or [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkaC] rescues the developmental defect of the ''amiB''- mutant. AmiB is thought to play a role early in development by stimulating [/gene/DDB_G0281545 acaA] expression which is essential for cAMP signaling ([/ontology/go/0007242/annotation/page/1 intracellular signaling cascade]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10651904 Kon et al. 2000]).<br />''amiB''- cells have aberrant morphology when placed in starvation buffer: rather than forming pseudopods, they form larger locomotory structures ressembling lamellipodia of fish keratocytes. The distribution of actin, [/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB], and [/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA] in ''amiB''- mutant is similar to that observed in fish keratocytes. These results suggest that AmiB is important for [/ontology/go/0006935/annotation/page/1 chemotaxis] and [/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motion] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15259052 Asano et al. 2004]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 02-DEC-2008 PG

DDB_G0282739	Pascale Gaudet	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates ([/ontology/go/0003899/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity]). Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB0216292 DDB0216292] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB0215406 DDB0215406] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB0215406 DDB0215406] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase II is composed of 12 subunits: [/gene/DDB0215406 DDB0215406], [/gene/DDB0187850 DDB0187850], [/gene/DDB0216289 DDB0216289], [/gene/DDB0204958 DDB0204958], [/gene/DDB0215452 DDB0215452], [/gene/DDB0219633 DDB0219633], [/gene/DDB0216295 DDB0216295], [/gene/DDB0204381 DDB0204381], [/gene/DDB0202109 DDB0202109], [/gene/DDB0216949 DDB0216949], [/gene/DDB0218015 DDB0218015], and[/gene/DDB0216300 DDB0216300]. Subunits 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are common to all threeRNA polymerases (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998). <br />Expression of ''rbp4'' in ''Dictyostelium'' is developmentally regulated, with highest expression at the loose aggregate stage. In vegetative cells and early developing cells, two transcripts are detected, while only the largest form of the transcript is found at later stages. In late development, the ''rbp4'' transcript is found in prespore cells. The Rpb4 protein is found both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Attempts to knock out ''rbp4'' have been unsuccessful ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18992223 Naorem and Sadhale 2008]). Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 17-NOV-2008 PG

DDB_G0275173	Pascale Gaudet	Two homeobox-containing proteins have been cloned and analyzed in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0291075 warA] and [/gene/DDB_G0275173 hbx2]. Their expression is developmentally regulatedstarting at the mound stage in response to cAMP and require the transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0288755 gbfA]. <br />''hbx2'' null mutants are morphologically indistinguishable from wild type cells. The double ''warA/hbx2'' knock out has a phenotype similar to the ''warA'' null mutant, with a slightly enhanced morphological phenotype. Many of the multicellular structures formed arrest at the mound stage,while the remainder proceed through development and form fruiting bodies with anenlarged basal disc and lower portion of the stalk, suggestingthere is an increase in the number of basal disc and stalk cells. This is supported by the observation that the pstO region of ''warA'' null cells is about twice the size of that of wild type cells, with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of prespore cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9486804 (Han and Firtel 1998)]. <br />The homeodomain is a [/ontology/go/0043565/annotation/page/1 sequence-specific DNA binding] motif that consists of a helix-turn-helix.

Recently it has been shown that the Phg2 protein also binds PI(4,5)P2 via a novel binding site, and this binding site is sufficient for [/ontology/go/0005886/annotation/page/1 plasma membrane] localization of the protein. This domain was also necessary for the rescue of the phagocytosis defect in the null mutant.

DDB_G0293524	Karen Kestin	''Dictyostelium'' [/gene/DDB_G0293524 ppk1] is highly similar to bacterial PPK, which exhibits [/ontology/go/0008976/annotation/page/1 polyphosphate kinase activity] inresponse to stress and starvation. PPK synthesizes long chains of polyphosphate (poly P), however, the ''ppk1-''mutant retains a low level of polyphospate kinase activity. The remaining kinase activity (DdPKK2 activity) is attributed,interestingly, to three proteins identified using mass spectrometry: [/gene/DDB_G0288937 arpA], [/gene/DDB_G0272106 arpB], and[/gene/DDB_G0289511 act28]. Inhibition of these three actin-related proteins with reagents affecting actinpolymerization (such as phalloidin) concomitantly inhibits poly P formation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496465 Gómez-García andKornberg 2004]). <br /> Disruption of the ''ppk1'' gene results in low levels of poly P ([/ontology/go/0006797/annotation/page/1 polyphosphate metabolic process]) and a growth defect attributed to a [/ontology/go/0006909/annotation/page/1 phagocytosis] defect. In addition, the ''ppk1'' mutant exhibits delayed culmination and a significantly reduced number of spore cells ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701689 Zhang et al. 2005]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 20-FEB-2008 PF
DDB_G0272110	Petra Fey	The ''gskA'' gene encodes the ''Dictyostelium'' homologue of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]). It is required for the cAMP induced formation of prespore cells and inhibition of stalk cells ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]). Disruption of ''gskA'' creates a mutant that aggregates but forms few spores and an abnormally high number of stalk cells [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7813009  (Harwood et al. 1995)]. Extracellular cAMP activates GskA through the cAMP receptor cAR3 ([/gene/DDB_G0277829 carC]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9847246  (Plyte et al. 1999)] and the tyrosine kinase ZAK1 ([/gene/DDB_G0276025 zakA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10571182  (Kim et al. 1999)], stimulating prespore differentiation. A second receptor, cAR4 ([/gene/DDB_G0277831 carD]), appears to negatively regulate GskA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9284050  (Ginsburg and Kimmel, 1997)], to promote prestalk formation. GskA itself was shown to phosphorylate STATa ([/gene/DDB_G0281381 dstA]) and enhance its nuclear export [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11032815  (Ginger et al. 2000)]. There is also evidence that GskA phosphorylation activates the beta-catenin homologue aardvark ([/gene/DDB_G0288877 aarA]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11130075  (Crimson et al. 2000)].<br />It has been proposed that cAMP receptor-mediated pathways ([/ontology/go/0007165/annotation/page/1 signal transduction]) converge at GskA suggesting that the anterior (prestalk) / posterior (prespore) axis of ''Dictyostelium'' is regulated by an ancient mechanism that is shared by the Wnt/Fz circuits for dorsoventral patterning during early ''Xenopus'' development, and establishing ''Drosophila'' segment polarity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9284050  (Ginsburg and Kimmel, 1997)]. In ''Dictyostelium'' it has been suggested that a single ligand, cAMP, activating receptors cAR3 and cAR4 with distinct affinities, alternatively either activates or inhibits, respectively, GskA-specific activity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10980428  (Kim and Kimmel, 2000)].<br />While the original ''gskA''-null mutant was created in the uracil auxotroph DH1 strain, Schilde ''et al.'' deleted the gene in AX2. This had the advantage of creating a mutant with a milder phenotype, where a significant number of cells progress through development with relatively normal spore/stalk cell proportions. In this AX2/''gskA''-null strain, early development is accelerated but slug migration is impaired. Consistent with the accelerated early development, cell-specific markers [/gene/DDB_G0277853 ecmA], [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], and [/gene/DDB_G0267412 pspA] are precociously expressed. ''ecmB'' expression in wildtype is restricted to the slug tip, just as they commit themselves to stalk cell differentiation. In the AX2/''gskA''-null mutant, however, ''ecmB'' is expressed throughout the prestalk region of the slug, suggesting that ''gskA'' is involved in a repressive signalling pathway preventing premature stalk cell commitment. Microarray analysis identified the large gene C2 family ([/gene/DDB_G0280847 2C]) that requires ''gskA'' for optimal expression, suggesting that ''gskA'' may also play an activator role [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342480  (Schilde et al. 2004)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 29-MAY-2007 PF

DDB_G0275617	Pascale Gaudet	The TATA binding protein (TBP) binds TATA elements located upstream of the transcription initiation site. In general, TBP is a known TFIID subunit, the large (~750-kDa) multisubunit complex composed of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs). It is a universal transcription factor, required for initiation by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases: [/gene/DDB_G0288449 rpc2], [/gene/DDB_G0288257 rpb2],and [/gene/DDB_G0293560 rpa2]. TBP-TATA association nucleates the assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex. The crystal structure of Arabidopsis TBP revealed a remarkable structure containing a new DNA binding fold, resembling a molecular "saddle" that sits astride the DNA (reviewed by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9618449 Hampsey] in 1998).<br />''D. discoideum'' TBP has been shown to be a component of TFIIIB, which includes [/gene/DDB_G0281215 brf1] and [/gene/DDB_G0283405 bdp1]. The protein also interacts with the ORF1 proteins of non LTR retrotransposons TRE5-A and TRE5-B, which both integrate upstream of tRNAs. The TBP structure has been determined and was found to be very similar to human TBP, and brf1 and ORF1 binding sites have been mapped ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900496  (Chung et al. 2007)]).

DDB_G0291075	Pascale Gaudet	Two homeobox-containing proteins have been cloned and analyzed in ''Dictyostelium'', [/gene/DDB_G0291075 warA] and [/gene/DDB_G0275173 hbx2]. Their expression is developmentally regulatedstarting at the mound stage in response to cAMP and require the transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0288755 gbfA]. <br />Approximately 30% of the multicellular structures made from ''warA'' null mutants arrest at the mound stage, while the remainder proceed through development and form fruiting bodies with anenlarged basal disc and lower portion of the stalk ([/ontology/go/0009653/annotation/page/1 anatomical structure morphogenesis]), suggestingthere is an increase in the number of basal disc and stalk cells. This is supported by the observation that the pstO region of ''warA'' null cells is about twice the size of that of wild type cells, with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of prespore cells ([/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation]). The double ''warA/hbx2'' knock out has a phenotype similar to the ''warA'' null mutant, with a slightly enhanced morphological phenotype [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9486804 (Han and Firtel 1998)]. <br />The homeodomain is a [/ontology/go/0043565/annotation/page/1 sequence-specific DNA binding] motif that consists of a helix-turn-helix.

DDB_G0293850	Pascale Gaudet	The size of ''Dictyostelium'' fruiting bodies is controlled at least in part by a secreted counting factor (CF), a multisubunit complex. The role of CF in size regulation has not yet been elucidated, although a negative effect on cytosolic glucose levels has been observed. <br />NADPH-coupled aldehyde reductase reduces a wide variety of aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols, including converting glucose to sorbitol ([/ontology/go/0042593/annotation/page/1 glucose homeostasis]). The levels of this enzyme appears to be regulated by CF. Cells in which the ''alrA'' gene, encoding aldehyde reductase ([/ontology/go/0004032/annotation/page/1 aldehyde reductase activity]), has been disrupted, form aggregates much larger than wild type cells ([/ontology/go/0031158/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of aggregate size involved in sorocarp development]). ''alrA''- cells have reduced [/ontology/go/0006928/annotation/page/1 cell motion]. ''alrA''- cells secrete reduced levels of [/gene/DDB_G0274597 ctnA] and [/gene/DDB_G0273175 cf50-1], two components of CF. This could explain why ''alrA''- cells form large groups ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14551196 Ehrenman et al. 2004]).<br />''alrA'' is highly upregulated by glutathione (GSH) depletion. The enzyme glutamate-cysteine ligase, encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0284651 gcsA], catalyzes the the first and limiting step in GSH biosynthesis. Null mutants in ''gcsA'' have an absolute requirement for exogenous GSH. ''alrA'' overexpression protects [/gene/DDB_G0284651 gcsA] null mutants from GSH depletion, while underexpression makes the cells more sensitive. ''alrA'' also protects from the toxic by-product of glycolysis methylglyoxal, by breaking it down to non-toxic lactic acid using GSH as a co-factor ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18990192 Choi et al. 2008]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 22-JAN-2009 PG

DDB_G0278781	CGM_DDB	''D. discoideum'' Pah is the only aromatic amino acid hydroxylase in this organism and has [/ontology/go/0004505/annotation/page/1 phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase activity]. Gel filtration showed this enzyme to form a tetramer ([/ontology/go/0051262/annotation/page/1 protein tetramerization]). As the most efficient cofactor this enzyme requires DH<sub>4</sub> (''D-threo''-BH<sub>4</sub>), and with lower efficiency BH<sub>4</sub>, which is the major cofactor of metazoan PAH enzymes ([/ontology/go/0034617/annotation/page/1 tetrahydrobiopterin binding]). However, ''Dictyostelium'' Pah cannot be activated by L-Phe like its metazoan counterparts. The low affinity for the substrate and the overall lower activity than human PAH may provide a constitutive level of activity in ''D. discoideum'', pointing to an anabolic function of Pah in lower eukaryotes and bacteria. A more strict allosteric regulation of the enzyme by L-Phe seems to be needed in higher eurkaryotes. By determining the structure of ''D. discoideum'' Pah, high similarity to human PAH in the catalytic domain was found. However, differing residues could be identified in the regulatory domain that might be important for cofactor selection and L-Phe binding ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18835579 Siltberg-Liberles et. al 2008)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated 21-MAY-2009 PF

DDB_G0291970	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium'' cofilin was identified through a search for actin monomer binding proteins ([/ontology/go/0003785/annotation/page/1 actin monomer binding]) in whole cell lysates. A 15 kDa protein was isolated and purified, which was shown to depolimerize actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0030042/annotation/page/1 actin filament depolymerization]) in a dose-dependent manner and to decrease the viscosity of actin filaments. This activity was inhibited by phosphatidylinositides. Cloning the cofilin gene resulted in the identification of 2 identical genes, [/gene/DDB_G0277833 cofA] and ''cofB'' that differed only in their intron and promoter sequence. When promoter activities were tested, only ''cofA'' was found to be expressed, predominantly in vegetative cells. No promoter activity was detected for ''cofB'', suggesting that ''cofB'' might be a pseudogene. This data is in conflict with the fact that several ESTs have been detected for this gene. Attempts to delete the ''cofA'' gene failed, while deletion of ''cofB'' yielded mutants with no detectable phenotype. This confirmed that ''cofB'' is not expressed and suggested that ''cofA'' is an essential gene [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7738034  (Aizawa et al., 1995) ]. <br />Overexpression of ''cofA'' was shown to stimulate bundling of actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0051017/annotation/page/1 actin filament bundle formation]) in alpha-actinin ([/gene/DDB_G0268632 abpA]) -induced actin latticeworks, probably by severing the filaments [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636212  (Aizawa et al., 1996) ]. In overexpressing cells also showed that cofilin, together with the actin-interacting protein [/gene/DDB_G0278733 DAip1], plays a pivotal role in reorganizing the actin bundles in response to hyperosmotic stress ([/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response]) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10421841  (Aizawa et al., 1999) ]. To investigate the actin depolimerization activity of cofilin further, Ichetovkin ''et al.'' showed, by two independent methods, that both native and recombinant cofilin sever actin filaments ([/ontology/go/0006972/annotation/page/1 hyperosmotic response]), but to different extents [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10744862  (Ichetovkin et al., 2000) ].<br />Recently, cofilin was found to be dependent on the MADS box transcription factor [/gene/DDB_G0281387 srfA]. The authors found an expression profile of cofilin that differed from that published for ''cofA''. While ''cofA'' expression was originally tested by promoter activity and later confirmed by western blot, this analysis was done by Northern blot. As a consequence of the discrepancy the authors referred in their paper not to cofilin A ([/gene/DDB_G0277833 cofA]), but to the identical cofilin B [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15075287  (Escalante et al., 2004) ].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-MAY-2004 PF

DDB_G0271514	Pascale Gaudet	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates ([/ontology/go/0003899/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity]). Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are found in eukaryotic nuclei: [/gene/DDB_G0275759 rpa1] for the ribosomal RNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006360/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase I promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005736/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase I complex]), [/gene/DDB_G0279193 rpb1] for the mRNA precursor ([/ontology/go/0006366/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005665/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, core complex]), and [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] for 5S and tRNA genes ([/ontology/go/0006383/annotation/page/1 transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter]), ([/ontology/go/0005666/annotation/page/1 DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex]).<br />RNA polymerase III is a multisubunit complex. The subunits encoded by [/gene/DDB_G0277199 rpc1] (ortholog of ''S. cerevisiae RPO31''), [/gene/DDB_G0293560 rpa2] (''RPC2''), [/gene/DDB_G0268080 rpc3] (''RPC82''),[/gene/DDB_G0277671 rpc4] (''RPC53''), [/gene/DDB_G0271514 rpc5] (''RPC37''), [/gene/DDB_G0286521 rpc9] (''RPC17''), [/gene/DDB_G0272022 rpc34] (''RPC34''), [/gene/DDB_G0273425 rpc25-1] (''RPC25''), and [/gene/DDB_G0287707 rpc11] (''RPC11'') are unique to RNA polymerase III. Orthologs of ''RPC31'' and ''RPC17'' have not been identified in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome. Two subunits, [/gene/DDB_G0291362 rpc19] and [/gene/DDB_G0282339 rpa5] (''RPC19'' and ''RPC40'' in ''S. cerevisiae''), are common to RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III and correspond to subunits 3 and 11 of RNA polymerase II. Subunits [/gene/DDB_G0291636 rpb5], [/gene/DDB_G0291037 rpb6], [/gene/DDB_G0278039 rpb8], [/gene/DDB_G0272036 rpb10], and [/gene/DDB_G0283365 rpb12] are common to all three RNA polymerases ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12407181 Peyroche et al. 2002], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381659 Schramm and Hernandez 2001]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-JUN-2009 PG

DDB_G0292390	Petra Fey	The ''atg1'' gene was isolated among several members of the autophagy family of genes, conserved from yeast to man ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626495 Otto et al., 2003]). Macroautophagy ([/ontology/go/0016236/annotation/page/1 macroautophagy]) is used by eukaryotic cells to recycle non-essential cellular components during starvation and development. ''atg1''-null mutants grow slower when compared to wild type. Survival during nitrogen starvation ([/ontology/go/0006995/annotation/page/1 cellular response to nitrogen starvation]) is severely reduced. Upon starvation mutant cells also show little turnover of cellular components. Multicellular [/ontology/go/0007275/annotation/page/1 multicellular organismal development] of the mutant is severely impaired. On bacterial lawns mutant cells do not aggregate, and axenically grown cells plated on filters form loose mounds only. Consistent with this block in development, ''atg1''-null cells produce no viable spores ([/ontology/go/0030435/annotation/page/1 sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore]). Wild-type cells in a chimaera do not rescue the developmental defects, showing that the atg1 mutation is autonomous. In the mutant, another autophagy protein, [/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8], shows a change in localization when compared with wild-type cells. The mutant phenotype of ''atg1''-null cells is the most severe compared with other autophagy mutants; [/gene/DDB_G0289881 atg5] and [/gene/DDB_G0271096 atg7] mutants have a comparative phenotype but slightly milder defects, while [/gene/DDB_G0269244 atg6A] and [/gene/DDB_G0286191 atg8] mutants show significantly milder defects ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736886 Otto et al., 2004]).<br />Kosta ''et al.'' investigated the relationship between autophagy and vacuolar cell death by deleting ''atg1'' in HMX44A cells, a ''Dictyostelium'' cell line that is able to develop as a monolayer. During [/ontology/go/0048102/annotation/page/1 autophagic cell death] after starvation and addition of DIF, wild-type cells develop large vacuoles before rupturing while HMX44A-atg1-null cells die, however, without the formation of vacuoles. Reproducing this result in different insertion and deletion mutants suggests that, in an autophagic vacuolar cell death model, the inactivation of ''atg1'' supresses vacuolization but not death ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15358773 Kosta et al., 2004]). Laporte ''et al.'' showed that, when stimulated, ''atg1''-null cells displayed not only developmental vacuolar cell death but also [/ontology/go/0070265/annotation/page/1 necrotic cell death], which is characterized by swift mitochondrial uncoupling, ATP depletion, and increased oxygen consumption ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16810325 Laporte et al., 2007], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17150370 Tresse et al., 2007]). Lam ''et al.'' found that the additional deletion of the only paracaspase gene ([/gene/DDB_G0293196 pcp]) in ''Dictyostelium'', which also appears to have no bcl-2 family members, did not have any effect on necrotic or autophagic cell death; the phenotype of the double atg1-/pcp- mutant is identical to the phenotype of the single ''atg1''- mutant ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17889831 Lam et al., 2007]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 8-JAN-2008 PF

DDB_G0291231	Petra Fey	MHCK A ([/gene/DDB_G0291231 mhkA]) was the first myosin heavy chain kinase identified, purified as a 130 kDa protein. It was found to phophorylate myosin II on the heavy chain (MHC, [/gene/DDB_G0286355 mhcA]) ([/ontology/go/0016905/annotation/page/1 myosin heavy chain kinase activity]), driving [/ontology/go/0031035/annotation/page/1 myosin filament disassembly] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027076  (Cote &amp; Bukiejko 1987)]. In this study MHCK A was found to phosphorylate threonine residues ([/ontology/go/0004674/annotation/page/1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity]), later these threonine residues were identified to be at positions 1823, 1833, and 2029 in the tail region of myosin II [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2839474  (Vaillancourt et al. 1988)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2387408  (Luck-Vielmetter et al. 1999)]. It was shown that MHCK A activity is activated by autophosphorylation ([/ontology/go/0046777/annotation/page/1 protein amino acid autophosphorylation]), and that the presence of myosin II increased the rate of autophosphorylation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2176841  (Medley et al. 1990)]. Furthermore it was shown that MHCK A has a high preference for threonine ([/ontology/go/0018107/annotation/page/1 peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18381083  Luo et al. 2001], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18381083  Crawley &amp; Cote et al. 2008])) and neighboring peptide residues important for substrate specificity have been determined ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18381083  Crawley &amp; Cote et al. 2008]).<br />In 1995, Futey ''et al.'' cloned the ''mhkA'' gene encoding MHCK A and found that no part of the sequence displayed significant similarity to the catalytic domain of conventional eukaryotic protein kinases. However, both native and recombinant MHCK A displayed bona fide kinase activity. In the 1,146 amino acid sequence they identified an N-terminal coiled-coil domain followed by a then uncharacterized central domain; the roughly 290 C-terminal amino acids were found to contain several G-protein beta WD-40 repeats [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7822274  (Futey et al. 1995)]. The WD40 repeat domain has been shown to directly bind myosin II ([/ontology/go/0045159/annotation/page/1 myosin II binding]) and to facilitate myosin phosphorylation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11106661  (Steimle et al. 2001) ]. The central domain was later identified as the unconventional Alpha kinase domain found in all ''Dictyostelium'' myosin heavy chain kinases and in metazoan elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) kinases (reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15050379  Drennan &amp; Ryazanov 2004)].<br />Crosslinking [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7822274  (Futey et al. 1995)] and in vivo truncation studies [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9201999  (Kolman &amp; Egelhoff 1997)] demonstrated that the N-terminal coiled-coil domain is responsible for [/ontology/go/0051260/annotation/page/1 protein homooligomerization], confirming earlier observations that the 130 kDa protein eluted from gel filtration columns with a molecular mass greater than 700 kDa [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027076  (Cote &amp; Bukiejko 1987)]. Other studies showed that the coiled-coil region is responsible for direct [/ontology/go/0051015/annotation/page/1 actin filament binding] in order to localize the enzyme to anterior F-actin-rich structures [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11959103  (Steimle et al. 2002)]. It has also been shown that the coiled-coil domain alone binds to F-actin and that this interaction increases the kinase activity 40-fold, suggesting that MHCK A recruitement to F-actin rich sites leading to its activation may represent a mechanism for localized disassembly of myosin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15545285  (Egelhoff et al. 2004)]. Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain represents a novel actin binding domain that is responsible for [/ontology/go/0051017/annotation/page/1 actin filament bundle formation] and [/ontology/go/0051764/annotation/page/1 actin crosslink formation] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16372899  (Russ et al. 2006)].<br />Deletion of the ''mhkA'' gene led to a strong decrease in MHC phosphorylation resulting in myosin II overassembly. However, defects in the null mutant were milder than defects in cells that overexpressed ''mhkA''; the overexpressing cells showed an increase in MHC phosphorylation and a decrease in myosin II assembly. In addition, these cells displayed reduced growth in suspension, a cytokinesis defect when grown in suspension, and an arrest of development at the mound stage [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8567716  (Kolman et al. 1996)]. These results are consistent with those in earlier studies; here cells that contained myosin that is nonphosphorylatable on MHCK A target sites (3XALA cells), or which is constantly pseudophosphorylated through introduction of aspartate residues, (3XASP cells) were investigated [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7691416  (Egelhoff et al. 1993)]. However, the amount of overassembled myosin was significantly lower in mhkA-null cells than in 3XALA cells, suggesting other MHCKs participate. These results indicate that partial myosin overassembly is not highly deleterious, but that hyperphosphorylation, which inhibits myosin assembly, significantly reduces myosin II function in vivo [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8567716  (Kolman et al. 1996)].<br />''Dictyostelium'' has 4 very related myosin heavy chain kinases (MHCK A-D). Three of those (''mhkA'', [/gene/DDB_G0289115 mhkB], [/gene/DDB_G0290687 mhkC]) have been cloned and characterized. The fourth, ([/gene/DDB_G0282489 mhkD]), a putative protein, is very similar to the other MHCKs in sequence and domain structure, making it likely to function as a MHCK (see review [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952069  De la Roche et al. 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 10-JUL-2008 PF

DDB_G0275815	Robert Dodson	The ''nramp2'' gene has been characterized by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992462  (Bozarro et al. 2013)] and found to localize exclusively to the contractile vacuole membrane. Knockout of the ''nramp2'' gene leads to an increased infection rate by Legionella pneumophila, while nramp2/nramp1 double knockout strains display aggregation defects. Single and double mutants display differential sensitivity to cell growth under conditions of iron overload or depletion, suggesting that Nramp1 and Nramp2 act synergistically to regulate iron homeostasis.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 25-JUL-2013 RD; annotation contributions PMID:22992462 Salvatore Bozzaro

DDB_G0275687	Pascale Gaudet	[/gene/DDB_G0275689 abcG2] and ''abcG18'' are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome as a tandem. In insertional mutant that disrupts both [/gene/DDB_G0275689 abcG2] and ''abcG18'' (''mdrA1/mdrA2'') results in release from the developmental block and the suppression of the defect in initial cell type choice caused by loss of the [/gene/DDB_G0271916 rtoA] gene. AbcG2 is localized to the endosome. ''abcG2-/abcG18-'' cells have an endocytosis rate roughly 70% that of wild-type ([/ontology/go/0006897/annotation/page/1 endocytosis]). The triple null ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' has even lower endocytosis rates, about 20% that of wild type cells. The exocytosis rates of ''abcG2-/abcG18-''and ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' are roughly that of wild-type. ''abcG2-/[/gene/DDB_G0275687 abcG18]-'' endosomes have an unusually high pH ([/ontology/go/0030641/annotation/page/1 regulation of cellular pH]), whereas ''abcG2-/abcG18-/rtoA-'' endosomes have an almost normal pH [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11719559  (Brazill et al. 2000)].<br />The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]). Seven different families have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. Sequences from the well-advanced ''Dictyostelium'' genome project have allowed to recognize 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) of this superfamily. The ABCG family is characterized by the ABC domain preceding the transmembrane domain([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). All of the members of this family in animals are half-transporters while all of the fungal members are full transporters with two ABC-transmembrane units. No members of this family are found in bacteria. ''Dictyostelium'' and ''Arabidopsis'' have members of both types[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012  (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].

DDB_G0293002	Pascale Gaudet	''tagA'' is expressed at the onset of development and is required for the differentiation of a subpopulation of prespore cells. Wild-type cells express ''tagA'' in prespore cells and in mature spores. TagA appears to be required for the specification of an initial population of prespore cells in which tagA is expressed ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]). ''tagA'' mutants elaborate multiple prestalk cell regions during development and produce spores asynchronously and with low viability. TagA appears to play a general role in [/ontology/go/0045595/annotation/page/1 regulation of cell differentiation] since ''tagA'' mutants express a spore coat protein gene, [/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB], within vacuolated cells that form part of the stalk and they express a prestalk/stalk-specific gene, [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], within cells that become spores[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12756178  (Good et al. 2003)]. <br />ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are [/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane] proteins involved [/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport] ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]).

These four genes have a similar structure, with a serine protease domain ([/ontology/go/0008236/annotation/page/1 serine-type peptidase activity]) N-terminal of the half-transporter, a domain organization unique to ''Dictyostelium''. ''tagA'' is located on chromosome 6, while the ''tagB'', ''tagC'' and ''tagD'' genes are located next to each other on chromosome 4 and appear to have arisen by tandem duplications. They encode proteins that are more than 65% identical, with the differences located mostly in the terminal regions.

DDB_G0287691	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]), ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and 13 ABCC family members: [/gene/DDB_G0280541 abcC1], [/gene/DDB_G0280055 abcC2], [/gene/DDB_G0287691 abcC3], [/gene/DDB_G0286559 abcC5], [/gene/DDB_G0287593 abcC6], [/gene/DDB_G0291243 abcC7], [/gene/DDB_G0284867 abcC8], [/gene/DDB_G0285165 abcC9], [/gene/DDB_G0280977 abcC10], [/gene/DDB_G0280973 abcC12], [/gene/DDB_G0280539 abcC13], [/gene/DDB_G0287589 abcC14], and [/gene/DDB_G0280459 abcC15]. Transporters of the C family have been shown to transport glutathione conjugants as well as to export cadmium ions. They are always found as full transporters with two copies of the transmembrane-ABC unit. Many of the genes of this family in humans and other animals have an additional transmembrane domain at the N terminus [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

DDB_G0288061	CGM_DDB	Using an apoaequorin expressing strain, Ludlow ''et al.'' showed that ''Dictyostelium'' posseses P2X receptors that facilitate rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in response to extracellular ATP and ADP. Deleting [/gene/DDB_G0272004 p2xA] or [/gene/DDB_G0288061 p2xE] did not influence this behavior, suggesting these genes are not involved. However, this study proposes possible roles for [/gene/DDB_G0275293 p2xB], [/gene/DDB_G0275191 p2xC], or [/gene/DDB_G0288335 p2xD] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486207  (Ludlow et al. 2008)].<br />Most recently, Ludlow ''et al.'' showed that p2xB and p2xE, as well as p2xA, have ATP-gated channel activity when expressed in ''Xenopus'' oocytes. However, Na<sup>+</sup> rather inhibited this activity to various degrees in these P2x channels, but K<sup>+</sup>, and NH4<sup>+</sup> ions elicited a large response. Interestingly, p2xA and p2xB, but not p2xE are permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. No such ATP-gated channel activity was found for p2xC and p2xD. All ''Dictyostelium'' P2x proteins localize to the [/ontology/go/0031164/annotation/page/1 contractile vacuolar membrane], and not to the plasma membrane like P2X receptors from other organisms. By using a protease protection assay on tagged receptors the authors demonstrated that the transmembrane loop region containing the agonist (ATP) binding site lies within the lumen of the vacuole. A quintuple p2xA/B/C/D/E null mutant in wild type background AX2 shows a reduced response to the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium, suggesting a role of the ''Dictyostelium'' proteins in the [/ontology/go/0050848/annotation/page/1 regulation of calcium-mediated signaling]. The quintuple null mutant also shows a slight delay in its [/ontology/go/0006971/annotation/page/1 hypotonic response] when placed in water, however, single mutants in a AX2 background do not show any osmoregulatory defect. Taken together, this study suggests that it is still unclear which molecules are responsible for the extracellular purinergic response in ''Dictyostelium'' and it raises the possibility that the P2x receptors may play a role in the release of intracellular Ca <sup>2+</sup> stores in response to an ATP stimulus from within the contractile vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833731  (Ludlow et al. 2009)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-MAR-2010 PF

DDB_G0281563	Pascale Gaudet	Members of the Myb family of transcription factors are typically composed of two or three imperfect repeats each of about 50 amino acids. These repeats fold into a variant of the helix-turn-helix motif have [/ontology/go/0003677/annotation/page/1 DNA binding] activity. The Myb motif has been well conserved during evolution (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999] and references therein).<br />''mybC'' was isolated as a REMI mutant that is unable to culminate ([/ontology/go/0031154/annotation/page/1 culmination during sorocarp development]). This defect is non-cell autonomous and can be rescued by overexpression of [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkac]. However even when their defect is bypassed, ''mybC'' null slugs and culminants produce little if any of the intercellular signalling peptides SDF-1 and SDF-2 that are believed to be released by prestalk cells atculmination. In ''mybC'' null cells, several culminationgenes are expressed at reduced levels: [/gene/DDB_G0269132 ecmB], [/gene/DDB_G0289075 spiA],[/gene/DDB_G0276941 cotA], and [/gene/DDB_G0276761 cotB].MybC was found in the [/ontology/go/0005634/annotation/page/1 nucleus] of prestalk cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331990 Guo et al. 1999]) using a beta-galactosidase gene driven by 1.85 kb of upstream sequence and the first 16 amino acids of mybC.

A quintuple p2xA/B/C/D/E null mutant in wild type background AX2 shows a reduced response to the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium, suggesting a role of the ''Dictyostelium'' proteins in the [/ontology/go/0050848/annotation/page/1 regulation of calcium-mediated signaling]. The quintuple null mutant also shows a slight delay in its [/ontology/go/0006971/annotation/page/1 hypotonic response] when placed in water, however, single mutants in a AX2 background do not show any osmoregulatory defect. Taken together, this study suggests that it is still unclear which molecules are responsible for the extracellular purinergic response in ''Dictyostelium'' and it raises the possibility that the P2x receptors may play a role in the release of intracellular Ca <sup>2+</sup> stores in response to an ATP stimulus from within the contractile vacuole [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833731  (Ludlow et al. 2009)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 11-MAR-2010 PF

DDB_G0280541	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]), ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and 13 ABCC family members: [/gene/DDB_G0280541 abcC1], [/gene/DDB_G0280055 abcC2], [/gene/DDB_G0287691 abcC3], [/gene/DDB_G0286559 abcC5], [/gene/DDB_G0287593 abcC6], [/gene/DDB_G0291243 abcC7], [/gene/DDB_G0284867 abcC8], [/gene/DDB_G0285165 abcC9], [/gene/DDB_G0280977 abcC10], [/gene/DDB_G0280973 abcC12], [/gene/DDB_G0280539 abcC13], [/gene/DDB_G0287589 abcC14], and [/gene/DDB_G0280459 abcC15]. Transporters of the C family have been shown to transport glutathione conjugants as well as to export cadmium ions. They are always found as full transporters with two copies of the transmembrane-ABC unit. Many of the genes of this family in humans and other animals have an additional transmembrane domain at the N terminus [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

Seven different families (A to G) have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and a single ABCE family member. The ABCE family is characterized by the presence of a conserved ferredoxin motif (pfam00037) at the N terminus, a motif found in nucleic acid binding proteins. They contain two ABC domains but no transmembrane domains and so are unlikely to act as transporters. In animals, ABCE protein has been shown to inhibit RNase L, the double-stranded RNA nuclease, and is referred to as RLi [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6420574  (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 19-SEP-2003 PG

DDB_G0286121	Pascale Gaudet	[/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB] and ''tagC'' null mutant aggregates exhibit a cell-autonomous defect in specialization of PST-A cells, a prestalk subpopulation that forms the tip and eventually forms the stalk of the fruiting body ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]). Cooperative (non-cell-autonomous) defects occur during sporulation and in specialization of prestalk cells that eventually form the upper cup of the fruiting body (PST-O). The homology of ''tagB'' and ''tagC'' with serine protease and multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter genes implies a mechanism of action that includes proteolysis and export of peptide signals[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7744252  (Shaulsky et al. 1995)]. Disruption of [/gene/DDB_G0285427 mkcA], [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA], ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8986798 Shaulsky et al. 1996]), or [/gene/DDB_G0280047 yelA] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9254905 Osherov et al. 1997]) partially suppresses the ''tagB'' and ''tagC'' phenotype. <br />TagC is required for the release of the spore-differentiation factor peptide SDF-2. SDF-2 can induce encapsulation of prespore cells. SDF-2 appears to stimulate prestalk cells to release additional SDF-2 by acting through a signal transduction pathway that also involves [/gene/DDB_G0280961 dhkA], [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA] and [/gene/DDB_G0283907 pkac] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9473320  Anjard et al. 1998]). <br />ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are [/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane] proteins involved [/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport] ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]).

DDB_G0275689	Pascale Gaudet	''abcG2'' and [/gene/DDB_G0275687 abcG18] are present in the ''Dictyostelium'' genome as a tandem. In insertional mutant that disrupts both ''abcG2'' and [/gene/DDB_G0275687 abcG18] (''mdrA1/mdrA2'') results in release from the developmental block and the suppression of the defect in initial cell type choice caused by loss of the [/gene/DDB_G0271916 rtoA] gene. AbcG2 is localized to the endosome ([/ontology/go/0005768/annotation/page/1 endosome]). ''abcG2-/abcG18-'' cells have an endocytosis rate roughly 70% that of wild-type ([/ontology/go/0006897/annotation/page/1 endocytosis]).

DDB_G0275157	Pascale Gaudet	LimF was isolated on the basis of its LIM domain, a domain important for cytoskeletal function. A two-hyrbrid screen was performed, which identified two interacting partners, [/gene/DDB_G0267490 ChLim], another LIM domain-containing protein, as well as [/gene/DDB_G0286553 rab21], a small GTPase of the Rab subfamily. The two amino LIM domains of LimF, LIM1 and LIM2, were able to bind ChLIM and Rab21, but not LIM3, the most carboxy LIM domain. ChLim and LimF interaction with Rab21 is not dependent on the ability of Rab21 to bind GTP. Mutations in these three genes indicate that ChLim play a role in the [/ontology/go/0050765/annotation/page/1 negative regulation of phagocytosis], while LimF and Rab21 are involved in the [/ontology/go/0050766/annotation/page/1 positive regulation of phagocytosis]. Consistent with this, during phagocytosis, LimF is found in the [/ontology/go/0001891/annotation/page/1 phagocytic cup] ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15962002 Khurana et al, 2005]).

DDB_G0269214	Pascale Gaudet	The ABC superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes. The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export ([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]). Seven different families have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. Sequences from the well-advanced ''Dictyostelium'' genome project have allowed to recognize 71 members of this superfamily (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication). The ABCG family is characterized by the ABC domain preceding the transmembrane domain ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). All of the members of this family in animals are half-transporters while all of the fungal members are full transporters with two ABC-transmembrane units. No members of this family are found in bacteria. ''Dictyostelium'' and ''Arabidopsis'' have members of both types ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 Anjard and Loomis 2002]).

The proteins encoded by these genes all carry a characteristic 200- to 250-amino-acid ATP-binding cassette that gives them their family name ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). In bacteria they are mostly involved in nutrient import, while in eukaryotes many are involved in export ([/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport]). Seven different families have been defined in eukaryotes based on sequence homology, domain topology, and function. Sequences from the well-advanced ''Dictyostelium'' genome project have allowed to recognize 71 members of this superfamily (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication). The ABCG family is characterized by the ABC domain preceding the transmembrane domain ([/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane]). All of the members of this family in animals are half-transporters while all of the fungal members are full transporters with two ABC-transmembrane units. No members of this family are found in bacteria. ''Dictyostelium'' and ''Arabidopsis'' have members of both types ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 Anjard and Loomis 2002]).

DDB_G0286119	Pascale Gaudet	''tagB'' gene expression marks the differentiation of the initial prestalk cell population, PST-I [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8631494 (Shaulsky and Loomis 1996)].''tagB'' and [/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC] null mutant aggregates exhibit a cell-autonomous defect in specialization of PST-A cells, a prestalk subpopulation that forms the tip and eventually forms the stalk of the fruiting body ([/ontology/go/0030154/annotation/page/1 cell differentiation]). Cooperative (non-cell-autonomous) defects occur during sporulation and in specialization of prestalk cells that eventually form the upper cup of the fruiting body (PST-O). The homology of ''tagB'' and [/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC] with serine protease and multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter genes implies a mechanism of action that includes proteolysis and export of peptide signals[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7744252  (Shaulsky et al. 1995)]. Disruption of [/gene/DDB_G0285427 mkcA], [/gene/DDB_G0284331 regA], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8986798  (Shaulsky et al. 1996)], or [/gene/DDB_G0280047 yelA][http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9254905  (Osherov et al. 1997)] partially suppresses the ''tagB'' and [/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC] phenotype. <br />ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are [/ontology/go/0016021/annotation/page/1 integral to membrane] proteins involved [/ontology/go/0006810/annotation/page/1 transport] ([/ontology/go/0042626/annotation/page/1 ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances]). ''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication). [/gene/DDB_G0293002 tagA], [/gene/DDB_G0286119 tagB], [/gene/DDB_G0286121 tagC], and [/gene/DDB_G0286123 tagD] are members of the B family of ABC transporters. These four genes have a similar structure, with a serine protease domain ([/ontology/go/0008236/annotation/page/1 serine-type peptidase activity]) N-terminal of the half-transporter, a domain organization unique to ''Dictyostelium''. ''tagA'' is located on chromosome 6, while the ''tagB'', ''tagC'' and ''tagD'' genes are located next to each other on chromosome 4 and appear to have arisen by tandem duplications. They encode proteins that are more than 65% identical, with the differences located mostly in the terminal regions. In the central region, their nucleotide sequences are more than 95% identical([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 Loomis and Anjard 2002]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

''Dictyostelium'' has 71 ABC transporters (including one on the chromosome 2 duplication) and 11 ABCA family members: [/gene/DDB_G0291994 abcA1], [/gene/DDB_G0267438 abcA2], [/gene/DDB_G0293436 abcA3], [/gene/DDB_G0274121 abcA4], [/gene/DDB_G0274119 abcA5], [/gene/DDB_G0291245 abcA6], [/gene/DDB_G0271140 abcA7], [/gene/DDB_G0271138 abcA8],[/gene/DDB_G0291980 abcA9], [/gene/DDB_G0283387 abcA10], and [/gene/DDB_G0275453 abcA11],One of the defining characteristics of the A family is the presence of a regulatory domain with multiple sites for phosphorylation by various protein kinases in the region after the first ABC domain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456012 (Anjard and Loomis 2002)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-JUN-2003 PG

DDB_G0306378	Petra Fey	In eukaryotic cells, asparagine-linked glycolysation is one of the most common protein modification reactions ([/ontology/go/0006487/annotation/page/1 protein amino acid N-linked glycosylation]) in the endoplasmic lumen. The protein complex responsible for these processes is the [/ontology/go/0008250/annotation/page/1 oligosaccharyltransferase complex] (OST). The OST is an integral membrane complex that mediates the transfer of a preassembled high mannose oligosaccharide onto asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides.

DDB_G0286359	Petra Fey	Severin kinase was identified by screening DEAE column fractions of a soluble cell homogenate for kinase activity by adding severin [/gene/DDB_G0289327 sevA], actin, or a severin-actin complex. Kinase activity was detected that phosphorylated severin alone, or in complex with actin. A 62 kDa polypeptide co-eluted with the protein kinase activity. Subsequently the ''svkA'' cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The ''svkA'' gene was found to encode a protein kinase that is, over it's entire length, 51 % identical and 64% similar to human SOK1, a STE20-like kinase that is induced by oxidative stress. Similarity is even higher when the N-terminal catalyic domains are compared (75% / 84%, respectively) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9582328  (Eichinger et al., 1998)]. <br />The substrate specificity of severin kinase has been tested with several other actin binding proteins and different domains of severin. Only severin residues 1-151 and 152-362 turned out to be substrates, suggesting that the kinase phosphorylates severin at at least two sites. Severin kinase is activated by autophosphorylation, and severin phosphorylation was shown to be reduced in the presence of Ca2+. The presence of a STE20-like severin kinase in ''Dictyostelium'' suggests a direct signal transduction induced by stress, from the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton by phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein severin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9582328  (Eichinger et al., 1998)].<br />When the svkA gene was deleted, the cells showed a strong cytokinesis phenotype leading to multinucleated cells sometimes with more than 30 nuclei. The defect stems from the frequent inability of svkA-knockout cells to maintain symmetry during formation of the cleavage furrow and to sever the last cytosolic connection. GFP-SvkA is enriched at the centrosome and localizes to the midzone during the final stage of cell division. This suggests that SvkA is part of a regulatory pathway from the centrosome to the midzone, thus regulating the completion of cell division [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18042625  (Rohlfs et al., 2007)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 18-DEC-2012 PF

DDB_G0267376	Robert Dodson	The ''acrA'' gene encodes the late developmental stage adenylate cyclase which is essential for spore encapsulation. This multi-domain protein contains a cyclase domain, transmembrane helices, a histidine kinase domain, and two receiver domains. The role of these domains in the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity was investigated by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966074  Chen, et al. 2012. ]Mutation of ATP-binding residues in the histidine kinase domain did not affect adenylate cyclase activity, however, the dimerizing histidine phosphoacceptor subdomain was found to be essential for adenylate cyclase activity.

DDB_G0269114	Petra Fey	Nucleomorphin is a calmodulin binding protein. The numA1 isoform was identified in an expression library screen for calmodulin binding proteins. This protein contains nuclear localization signals (NLS), a Calcium-Calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD), and a glu/asp rich repeat (DEED). A GFP-numA1 fusion protein localized to patches in the nucleoplasm. Cells expressing GFP-NumA1 lacking the acidic DEED repeat showed an increased number of nuclei, which suggests numA1 regulates mitosis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11919178  (Myre &amp; O'Day 2002)]. A longer isoform, numA2, contains an additional BRCT (Breast Cancer C-Terminal) domain found predominantly in proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint functions responsive to DNA damage. While the shorter transcript is uniformly expressed throughout development, the larger transcript is expressed at low levels during vegetative growth, increasing by 4 h to remain high throughout development [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15535983 (Myre &amp; O'Day 2004a)]. A two-hybrid screen using numA1 as a bait identified [/gene/DDB_G0283153 cbpD1], a calcium binding protein, to bind numA1, and this interaction required presence of the DEED domain [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15325281 (Myre &amp; O'Day 2004b)]. It has also been shown that the NLS, not the CaMBD, is sufficient for nuclear translocation of numA1, and that the nuclear localization is crucial for its ability to regulate the nuclear number [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15896312 (Myre &amp; O'Day 2005)].<br />In normal development, numA1 is highly expressed in vegetative cells and expression decreases 80% over the first 4 hours starvation. Differentiation inducing factor 1 (DIF-1) completely blocked the starvation-induced decrease in numA1. Conversely, treatment of vegetative cells with cAMP or ammonia, decreased numA1 expresssion. These results show that numA1 expression is regulated by developmental morphogens [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19000924 (O'Day et al. 2008)].<br />In 2011, mumA1 has been found to localize to nucleoli and to a lesser degree to the nucleoplasm in interphase. During mitosis, numA1 relocalizes to the centrosome and nuclear envelope. Nuclear or nucleolar localization signals ((NLS/NoLSs) have been mapped [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21327858 (Catalano &amp; O'Day 2011)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 23-OCT-2012 PF

DDB_G0285253	Robert Dodson	''scrA'' was isolated as a suppressor of the [/gene/DDB_G0288179 carB] phenotype, developmental arrest at the mound stage. SCAR orthologs exist in mammals, flies, fish, but not in yeasts, plants, or in bacteria. Scar is part of the SCAR complex consisting of [/gene/DDB_G0285253 scrA], [/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA], [/gene/DDB_G0279175 hspc300], [/gene/DDB_G0287855 pirA], and [/gene/DDB_G0274519 napA] and involved in positive regulation of actin filament polymerization. The first 96 amino acids of ScrA are necessary for interaction with [/gene/DDB_G0267956 abiA] and [/gene/DDB_G0279175 hspc300]. This interaction is essential for SCAR complex function as the deletion of the amino terminus in ''scrA'' causes defects in chemotaxis to cAMP and cytokinesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314411 Caracino et al. 2007]).<br />''scrA'' null mutants grow at normal rates but are smaller in size than normal wild type. The cytoskeleton is aberrant in ''scrA''- cells: there is decreased levels of filamentous actin, suggesting a role for SCAR in positive regulation of actin filament polymerization. Moreover, these cells are less polarized during aggregation and have an increased tendency to for lateral pseudopods. ''scrA'' null develops approximately 3 hours faster than wild type cells and form multiple tips. Each tip forms an individual slug and a relatively normal fruiting body ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9732292 Bear et al. 1998]).<br />SCAR/WAVE is activated during mitosis and localizes to the cell poles, driving the separation of daughter cells. SCAR activity was shown to be essential for myosin-independent cytokinesis, stabilizing the cleavage furrow and thus ensuring symmetrical cell division. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20530573 King et al. 2010]).<br />In wild type cells, SCAR recruitment occurs in patches of activated Rac. This causes Arp2/3 recruitment and pseudopod formation but also (directly or indirectly) results in Rac1 inactivation. When SCAR function is lost, by deletion of the ''scrA'' gene or any regulatory members of the SCAR complex, this Rac inactivation no longer occurs, and the level of activated Rac increases. When the level of activated Rac becomes high enough, WASP ([/gene/DDB_G0293834 wasA]) is recruited through its CRIB domain and thus effectively replaces the functions of SCAR ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891261 Veltman et al. 2012]).<br />''scrA'' mRNA is expressed maximally at the aggregation stage.

DDB_G0272486	Robert Dodson	The sec7 gene has been characterized in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23915312  (Muller et al. 2013)]. Sec7 was observed in both the cytosol and the plasma membrane, yet is absent from the plasma membrane when cells formed pseudopods, macropinosomes or phagosomes. Analysis of a sec7 knockout implicates the protein in processes that are related to membrane flow and actin dynamics such as phagocytosis and cell motility; however cellular properties associated with mammalian cytohesins such as cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion were not altered.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 16-AUG-2013 RD; annotation contributions PMID:23915312 Angelika Noegel

DDB_G0273737	Petra Fey	Members of the casein kinase I (CK1) family of serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in many cellular processes. Casein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate the 14-3-3 ([/gene/DDB_G0269138 fttB]) protein in mammals, play a role in Wnt signaling in ''Xenopus laevis'' and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', and maintain circadian rhythms in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. Additionally, CK1 plays a role in DNA repair in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).<br />Two casein kinase I family members have been identified in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', ''cak1'' and [/gene/DDB_G0292354 DDB_G0292354]. Cak1 is highly similar to CK1s in yeast and in metazoans. DDB0216336 is a putative casein kinase I that is highly similar to the CK1 subfamily tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12471243 Manninget al. 2002]). The Cak1 protein has been shown to phosphorylate casein when it is expressed in ''E. coli'' cells, and localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in immunofluorescence assays. Null mutations and overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Cak1 fail to produce viable cells, indicating that this protein may be essential for growth. Overexpression of wild-type Cak1 results in decreased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea; this suggests a role for Cak1 in DNA repair ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880352 Moreno-Bueno et al. 2000]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 05-MAY-2004 KP

DDB_G0273725	Petra Fey	Dictyostelium Snf12 is an ortholog of yeast SNF12 and of human BAF60a. Both Dictyostelium Snf12 and human BAF60a possess a SWIB domain and a conserved COG domain.

DDB_G0283453	Petra Fey	Cyclic di-(3':5')-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), a major prokaryote signalling intermediate, has been identified in the eukaryote ''Dictyostelium''. the DgcA protein synthesizes c-di-GMP in a GTP-dependent manner and is expressed at the slug tip, the site of stalk cell differentiation. Disruption of the DgcA gene blocks fruiting body development at the stage of slug migration. Culmination and stalk formation are restored by exposing DgcA-null slugs to wild type secretion products or to c-di-GMP. Moreover, c-di-GMP specifically induces stalk gene expression in cell monolayers. <br />Like the bacterial proteins, Dictyostelium DgcA contains a C-terminal GGDEF domain, which is essential for DgcA function. DgcA has been identified in all four clades of Dictyostelia, and the ''P. pallidum'' DgcA (PPA_G1423310) expressed in the ''D. discoideum'' DgcA null mutant restores stalk formation and culmination. This research identifies the long-elusive stalk-inducing morphogen and a role for c-di-GMP in eukaryotes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22864416  (Chen and Schaap, 2012)].

DDB_G0283615	Petra Fey	''rpkA'' is a member of a characterized class of G protein-coupled receptors found in ''Dictyostelium'' and in the plant pathogen ''Phytophthora'' and that contain a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) domain at the carboxyl terminus of the protein ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16876997 Bakthavatsalam et al. 2006]). In ''Dictyostelium'', ''rpkA'' is constitutively expressed and localizes to the endosome. <br />Null mutants in ''rpkA'' fail to aggregate at low cell density due to their inability to respond to cAMP and CMF (conditioned medium factor). The G protein domain of the protein is sufficient to rescue the developmental defects of ''rpkA''-. No role for the PIP5K domain in development has been found, but this domain is required for proper localization of the protein. Double mutants in ''rpkA'' and [/gene/DDB_G0283349 gpaA] (G alpha 1) can bypass the developmental defect of ''rpkA'' nulls, indicating that RpkA is an effector of G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17481898 Bakthavatsalam et al. 2007]). <br />RpkA is also involved in phagocytosis and in the response to infectious bacteria. The protein localizes to late phagosomes, and colocalizes with and binds [/gene/DDB_G0287127 vatA] and [/gene/DDB_G0291858 vatM]. The PIPK domain binds predominantly monophosphorylated phosphoinositides and also phosphatidylserine and loss of RpkA leads to reduced levels of phosphoinositides ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22073313 Riyahi et al. 2011]).Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 01-NOV-2012 PF
DDB_G0288511	Petra Fey	The ''sadA'' gene has been identified by its disruption in a substrate adhesion-deficient REMI mutant. SadA- cells grow in plastic dishes without attaching to the substrate (GO:0031589 cell-substrate adhesion). The sadA- mutant also shows slightly impaired cytokinesis (GO:0000910), aberrant actin filament organization (GO:0007015), and a phagocytosis (GO:0006909) defect. Deletion of the sadA gene by homologous recombination recreated the original mutant phenotype. Expression of sadA-GFP in sadA-null cells restored the wild-type phenotype. SadA-GFP localized to the cell surface, appropriate for an adhesion molecule (GO:0016020 membrane). SadA contains nine putative transmembrane domains (GO:0005887 integral to plasma membrane) and three conserved EGF-like repeats in a predicted extracellular domain. EGF repeats are found in proteins known to be involved in adhesion, such as tenascins and integrins, suggesting that sadA is the first substrate adhesion receptor to be identified in Dictyostelium [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12499361  (Fey et al. 2002)]. <br /> Kowal and Chisholm showed that the cytoplasmic tail of the SadA protein has an important function in cell-substrate adhesion. A SadA tailless mutant was unable to rescue the sadA adhesion deficiency and overexpression of the SadA tail domain reduced adhesion in wild-type cells. Mutation analysis revealed that the phosphorylation status of serine residues in the tail region plays a role in adhesion. In fractionation assays SadA was found in the insoluble fraction (GO:0005626) and was also identified to interact with the actin bundling protein Cortexillin I ([/gene/DDB_G0289483 ctxA]). This might suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates adhesion through the binding of SadA to Cortexillin I [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21441344  (Kowal and Chisholm 2011)].<br /> SadA also plays a role in cell adhesion by controlling the levels of [/gene/DDB_G0287363 sibA] adhesion molecules at the cell surface by stabilizing the intracellular SibA protein and possibly by assisting intracellular transport to the surface[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22219373  (Froquet et al. 2012)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 27-SEP-2012 PF; annotation contributions: PMID 22219373 Pierre Cosson.
DDB_G0275711	Petra Fey	The [/gene/DDB_G0275711 nhe1] gene, predicted to have sodium-hydrogen antiporter activity, is expressed in chemotactically competent cells but not in vegetative cells. Immunostaining for Nhe1 shows that the protein is localized at the membrane, cytoplasm, and in the leading edge membrane of chemotaxing cells. Null ''nhe1-'' cells have a reduced level of intracellular pH (regulation of intracellular pH), a reduced chemotaxis rate, and mislocalized F-actin. Additionally, ''nhe1-'' cells do not have a polarized cell morphology, however, they retain the ability to sense a gradient, as indicated by asymmetric localization of GFP-CRAC ([/gene/DDB_G0285161 dagA]) in response to a PI3-kinase inhibitor ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15851518 Patel and Barber 2005]). <br /> Barber and colleagues showed that expression of the [/gene/DDB_G0278733 aip1] gene suppresses the ''nhe-'' chemotaxis and F-actin assembly phenotype, while expressing just a C-terminal fragment enhances these phenotypes. Since the Aip1 C-terminal fragment binds cofilin they suggest a cooperative role of Aip1 and cofilin in pH-dependent cell migration, and that the defective chemotaxis in ,''nhe1-'' cells is determined primarily by loss of cofilin-dependent actin dynamics ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668166 Patel and Barber 2010]).<br /> Extracellular Ca2+ and K+ have long been known to affect cell motility. Nhe1 plays no role in Ca2+ facilitation or the Ca2+ requirement for chemotactic orientation. However, Nhe1 has been shown to be involved in both K+ facilitation for motility (at a minimum of 15 mM) and a K+/ Na+ requirement for chemotactic orientation.

DDB_G0272861	Robert Dodson	''cosA'' was identified by a genetic screen in ''D. discoideum'' for chemotaxis-defective mutants. Its gene product 'costars' belongs to the costars family, and has sequence similarity to the C-terminal region of the mammalian protein striated muscle activator of Rho signaling (STARS). ''cosA'' expression has been shown to be developmental regulated, with expression peaking during the early stages of development. cosA- cells exhibit chemotactic and developmental defects, which have been further shown to be linked to a role for costars in modulating actin cystoskeletal dynamics and cell motility.

DDB_G0293008	Petra Fey	''Dictyostelium cpnA'' belongs to the highly conserved copines, a family of ubiquitious Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. In their N-terminal half, copines contain two Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding domains (C2 domains) present in such proteins as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Much of the C-terminal half consists of a von Willebrand Factor type A domain (VWFA) typically found in the extracellular portions of membrane proteins like integrins. Thus copines represent a fusion of intracellular (C2) and extracellular (VWFA) domains. However, there are no signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane sequences in the predicted proteins suggesting copines are intracellular proteins. Copines are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking. It is of particular interest that copines, first found in the highly phagocytic protozoan ''Paramecium'' and then isolated from mammalian spleen and liver, seem to be abundant in cells and organs that are, or contain, phagocytes. In this context it comes as no surprise that phagocytic ''Dictyostelium'' has a total of six copine genes. The widespread distribution of copines from protozoans to mammals and their high similarity suggest they play important role(s) in eukaryotic biology. Reviewed in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12440769  (Tomsig and Creutz, 2001)].<br />CpnA has been shown to be expressed throughout the life cycle and to bind ''Dictyostelium'' membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. A GFP-CpnA fusion construct showed CpnA to localize to the cytosol, and transiently, in a calcium-dependent manner, to the plasma membrane, the contractile vacuolar membrane, the phagocytic vesicle membrane, and to membranes of the endolysosomal pathway [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343335  (Damer et al. 2005)].<br />Smith and colleagues found that CpnA is involved in the regulation of aggregation, slug size, and culmination during ''Dictyostelium'' development. In addition, CpnA seems to be involved in the function and differentiation of prestalk cells and plays a role in a calcium-regulated signaling pathway critical to triggering the initiation of culmination [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20525180  (Smith et al. 2010)].Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 21-AUG-2012 PF

DDB_G0268616	Robert Dodson	The ''Dictyostelium'' XMAP215 family member DdCP224 encoded by the ''cepJ'' gene is involved in centrosome duplication and cytokinesis and is concentrated at the centrosome and microtubule tips. The functions of the N- and C-terminal halves of DdCP224 were investigated using GFP-fusion proteins. The N-terminal construct shows only cytosolic localization, whereas the C-terminal construct localizes exclusively to the centrosome. Both ends of the protein are required for microtubule binding ''in vitro'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10769206 Graf et al. 2000], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12134070 Rehberg and Graf 2002]). Overexpression of the ''cepJ'' gene leads to supernumerary microtubule-organizing centers and, independently, an increase of the number of multinuclear cells. In contrast, underexpression of ''mtaA'' inhibits cell growth, reduces the number and length of astral microtubules, and causes nocodazole hypersensitivity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14517319 Graf et al. 2003]).Basic annotations have been added to this gene, 26-SEP-2012 RD

DDB_G0293196	Robert Dodson	Lam ''et al.'' found that the additional deletion of the pcp gene in an [/gene/DDB_G0292390 atg1] null background does not have any effect on necrotic or autophagic cell death; the phenotype of the double atg1-/pcp- mutant is identical to the phenotype of the single ''atg1''- mutant. Thus, in ''Dictyostelium'', which also appears to have no bcl-2 family members, autophagic cell death and necrotic cell death are independent of caspases and bcl-2 proteins ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17889831 Lam et al., 2007]).<br />([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23938384 Saheb et al., 2013]) revealed that Pcp was associated with the contractile vacuole membrane, and using a yeast two-hybrid system identified VatM as a protein interacting partner with Pcp. GFP-Pcp over-expressing cells were susceptible to osmotic stress and in hypo-osmotic conditions were rounded and contained more abnormally swollen contractile vacuoles. Their work suggests that Pcp is essential for Dictyostelium osmotic regulation via its functioning in the contractile vacuole system.Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 28-AUG-2013 RD

Other domains found in Roco proteins include WD40 repeats, cNB/CNMP (cyclicnucleotide binding), PH (pleckstrin homology), and RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) domains ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14654223 Bosgraaf and Van Haastert 2003]). Eleven ''Dictyostelium'' proteins belong to the Roco family: [/gene/DDB_G0291079 gbpC], [/gene/DDB_G0273259 qkgA-1], [/gene/DDB_G0269250 pats1], [/gene/DDB_G0288251 roco4], [/gene/DDB_G0294533 roco5], [/gene/DDB_G0279417 roco6], [/gene/DDB_G0267472 roco7], [/gene/DDB_G0286127 roco8], [/gene/DDB_G0288183 roco9], [/gene/DDB_G0291710 roco10], and [/gene/DDB_G0268636 roco11].<br />([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348387 van Egmond and van Haastert 2010]) identified developmental defects in roco4- cells during the transition from mound to fruiting body; prestalk cells produce reduced levels of cellulose, leading to unstable stalks that are unable to properly lift the spore head. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22689969 Gilsbach, et al. 2013]) solved the structure of Roco4 kinase wild-type, Parkinson disease-related mutants G1179S and L1180T and the structure of Roco4 kinase in complex with the LRRK2 inhibitor H1152. Serine 1187 and serine 1189 were shown to be essential for kinase activity.<br />Gene has been comprehensively annotated, 15-SEP-2004 KP
