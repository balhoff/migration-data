  abstract = {Genes with sequence similarity to the yeast tRNA(His) guanylyltransferase
	(Thg1) gene have been identified in all three domains of life, and
	Thg1 family enzymes are implicated in diverse processes, ranging
	from tRNA(His) maturation to 5'-end repair of tRNAs. All of these
	activities take advantage of the ability of Thg1 family enzymes to
	catalyze 3'-5' nucleotide addition reactions. Although many Thg1-containing
	organisms have a single Thg1-related gene, certain eukaryotic microbes
	possess multiple genes with sequence similarity to Thg1. Here we
	investigate the activities of four Thg1-like proteins (TLPs) encoded
	by the genome of the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum (a member
	of the eukaryotic supergroup Amoebozoa). We show that one of the
	four TLPs is a bona fide Thg1 ortholog, a cytoplasmic G(-1) addition
	enzyme likely to be responsible for tRNA(His) maturation in D. discoideum.
	Two other D. discoideum TLPs exhibit biochemical activities consistent
	with a role for these enzymes in mitochondrial 5'-tRNA editing, based
	on their ability to efficiently repair the 5' ends of mitochondrial
	tRNA editing substrates. Although 5'-tRNA editing was discovered
	nearly two decades ago, the identity of the protein(s) that catalyze
	this activity has remained elusive. This article provides the first
	identification of any purified protein that appears to play a role
	in the 5'-tRNA editing reaction. Moreover, the presence of multiple
	Thg1 family members in D. discoideum suggests that gene duplication
	and divergence during evolution has resulted in paralogous proteins
	that use 3'-5' nucleotide addition reactions for diverse biological
	functions in the same organism.},

  abstract = {To many pathogenic bacteria, human hosts are an evolutionary dead
	end. This begs the question what evolutionary forces have shaped
	their virulence traits. Why are these bacteria so virulent? The coincidental
	evolution hypothesis suggests that such virulence factors result
	from adaptation to other ecological niches. In particular, virulence
	traits in bacteria might result from selective pressure exerted by
	protozoan predator. Thus, grazing resistance may be an evolutionarily
	exaptation for bacterial pathogenicity. This hypothesis was tested
	by subjecting a well characterized collection of 31 Escherichia coli
	strains (human commensal or extra-intestinal pathogenic) to grazing
	by the social haploid amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. We then assessed
	how resistance to grazing correlates with some bacterial traits,
	such as the presence of virulence genes. Whatever the relative population
	size (bacteria/amoeba) for a non-pathogenic bacteria strain, D. discoideum
	was able to phagocytise, digest and grow. In contrast, a pathogenic
	bacterium strain killed D. discoideum above a certain bacteria/amoeba
	population size. A plating assay was then carried out using the E.
	coli collection faced to the grazing of D. discoideum. E. coli strains
	carrying virulence genes such as iroN, irp2, fyuA involved in iron
	uptake, belonging to the B2 phylogenetic group and being virulent
	in a mouse model of septicaemia were resistant to the grazing from
	D. discoideum. Experimental proof of the key role of the irp gene
	in the grazing resistance was evidenced with a mutant strain lacking
	this gene. Such determinant of virulence may well be originally selected
	and (or) further maintained for their role in natural habitat: resistance
	to digestion by free-living protozoa, rather than for virulence per
	se.},

	the first subprocess of chemorepulsion, in Dictyostelium discoideum-a
	well characterized model eukaryotic system. We take the first steps

	framework. This network describes the underlying pathways of chemorepellent
	gradient sensing in D. discoideum. Working within this modelling

	and species in this network can lead to a chemorepulsive response.
	We also analyse the possible role of additional regulatory effects
	(such as additional receptor regulation of enzymes in this network)
	and if this is necessary to achieve this behaviour. Thus we have
	investigated the receptor regulation of important enzymes and feedback
	effects in the network. This modelling framework generates important
	insights into and testable predictions regarding the role of key

	This finding opened the way to extensive studies in both D. discoideum

	provided new opportunities to test whether pharmacological intervention
	might increase sensitivity. Thus it is of considerable clinical significance

  abstract = {Infection of the zebrafish with Mycobacterium marinum is regarded
	as a well-established experimental model to study the pathogenicity
	of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Herein, a M. marinum transposon mutant
	library was screened for attenuated M. marinum phenotypes using a
	Dictyostelium discoideum assay. In one attenuated mutant, the transposon
	was located within tesA, encoding a putative type II thioesterase.
	Thin-layer chromatography analyses indicated that the tesA::Tn mutant
	failed to produce two major cell wall-associated lipids. Mass spectrometry
	and nuclear magnetic resonance clearly established the nature of
	missing lipids as phthioglycol diphthioceranates and phenolic glycolipids,
	respectively, indicating that TesA is required for the synthesis
	of both lipids. When injected into the zebrafish embryo bloodstream,
	the mutant was found to be highly attenuated, thus validating the
	performance and relevance of the Dictyostelium screen. Consistent
	with these in vivo findings, tesA::Tn exhibited increased permeability
	defects in vitro, which may explain its failure to survive in host
	macrophages. Unexpectedly, virulence was retained when bacteria were
	injected into the notochord. Histological and ultrastructural studies
	of the infected notochord revealed the presence of actively proliferating
	mycobacteria, leading to larval death. This work presents for the
	first time the notochord as a compartment highly susceptible to mycobacterial
	infection.},

	Analysis (PCA) of time-lapse measurements of cell shape and traction

	these shape changes are implemented at a slower pace in Myosin II

	few with only four modes accounting for 75% of the variance in all

	of the C-terminal eukaryotic CaaX motif of AnkB and is independent
	of the F-box and the two ANK domains, which has never been demonstrated

	mathematical model that describes such a system should reflect this
	feature. Especially, persistence of oscillatory behavior is an important
	issue. A benchmark model for this phenomenon is the Laub-Loomis model,
	a nonlinear model for cAMP oscillations in Dictyostelium discoideum.
	This model captures the most important features of biomolecular networks
	oscillating at constant frequencies. Nevertheless, the robustness
	of its oscillatory behavior is not yet fully understood. Given a
	system that exhibits oscillating behavior for some set of parameters,
	the central question of robustness is how far the parameters may
	be changed, such that the qualitative behavior does not change. The
	determination of such a "robustness region" in parameter space is
	an intricate task. If the number of parameters is high, it may be
	also time consuming. In the literature, several methods are proposed
	that partially tackle this problem. For example, some methods only
	detect particular bifurcations, or only find a relatively small box-shaped
	estimate for an irregularly shaped robustness region. Here, we present
	an approach that is much more general, and is especially designed
	to be efficient for systems with a large number of parameters. As
	an illustration, we apply the method first to a well understood low-dimensional
	system, the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. This is a predator-prey model
	featuring satiation of the predator. It has only two parameters and
	its bifurcation diagram is available in the literature. We find a
	good agreement with the existing knowledge about this model. When
	we apply the new method to the high dimensional Laub-Loomis model,
	we obtain a much larger robustness region than reported earlier in
	the literature. This clearly demonstrates the power of our method.
	From the results, we conclude that the biological system underlying
	is much more robust than was realized until now.},

  abstract = {When cells are exposed to hyperosmotic stress, the Dictyostelium STAT
	orthologue STATc is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated. Previous observations
	suggest a non-paradigmatic mode of STAT activation, whereby stress-induced
	serine phosphorylation of the PTP3 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibits
	its activity towards STATc. We show that two serine residues in PTP3,
	S448 and S747, are rapidly phosphorylated after osmotic stress. cGMP
	is a second messenger for hyperosmotic stress response and 8-bromo-cGMP,
	a membrane-permeable form of cGMP, is a known activator of STATc.
	GbpC, a cGMP-binding Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein,
	is a founder member of a protein family that includes LRRK2, the
	gene commonly mutated in familial Parkinson's disease. Genetic ablation
	of gbpC prevents STATc activation by 8-bromo-cGMP. However, osmotic-stress-induced
	activation of STATc occurs normally in the gbpC null mutant. Moreover,
	8-bromo-cGMP does not stimulate phosphorylation of S448 and S747
	of PTP3 in a wild-type strain. These facts imply the occurrence of
	redundant activation pathways. We present evidence that intracellular
	Ca(2+) is a parallel second messenger, by showing that agents that
	elevate intracellular Ca(2+) levels are potent STATc activators that
	stimulate phosphorylation of S448 and S747. We propose that stress-induced
	cGMP signalling exerts its stimulatory effect by potentiating the
	activity of a semi-constitutive tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates
	STATc, whereas parallel, stress-induced Ca(2+) signalling represses
	STATc dephosphorylation through its inhibitory effect on PTP3.},

	TRE5-A of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum generates a

	from element-internal promoters, located in the A module and the
	C module, respectively. We observed that TRE5-A retrotransposons

	levels of TRE5-A transcripts and that CbfA supports the retrotransposition
	activity of TRE5-A elements. The carboxy-terminal domain of CbfA
	was found to be required and sufficient to mediate the accumulation

  abstract = {Differential cell motility, which plays a key role in many developmental
	processes, is perhaps most evident in examples of pattern formation
	in which the different cell types arise intermingled before sorting
	out into discrete tissues. This is thought to require heterogeneities
	in responsiveness to differentiation-inducing signals that result
	in the activation of cell type-specific genes and 'salt and pepper'
	patterning. How differential gene expression results in cell sorting
	is poorly defined. Here we describe a novel gene (hfnA) that provides
	the first mechanistic link between cell signalling, differential
	gene expression and cell type-specific sorting in Dictyostelium.
	HfnA defines a novel group of evolutionarily conserved HECT ubiquitin
	ligases with an N-terminal filamin domain (HFNs). HfnA expression
	is induced by the stalk differentiation-inducing factor DIF-1 and
	is restricted to a subset of prestalk cells (pstO). hfnA(-) pstO
	cells differentiate but their sorting out is delayed. Genetic interactions
	suggest that this is due to misregulation of filamin complex activity.
	Overexpression of filamin complex members phenocopies the hfnA(-)
	pstO cell sorting defect, whereas disruption of filamin complex function
	in a wild-type background results in pstO cells sorting more strongly.
	Filamin disruption in an hfnA(-) background rescues pstO cell localisation.
	hfnA(-) cells exhibit altered slug phototaxis phenotypes consistent
	with filamin complex hyperactivity. We propose that HfnA regulates
	filamin complex activity and cell type-specific motility through
	the breakdown of filamin complexes. These findings provide a novel
	mechanism for filamin regulation and demonstrate that filamin is
	a crucial mechanistic link between responses to differentiation signals
	and cell movement in patterning based on 'salt and pepper' differentiation
	and sorting out.},

	kinases have been shown to function during development in regulating
	several processes. We show here that expression of an unregulated,
	activated kinase domain greatly inhibits cell proliferation. The
	inhibitory effect on proliferation is not due to a general inhibition
	of translation. Instead, it is due to enhanced production of a secreted
	factor(s). Indeed, extracellular CfaD and AprA proteins, but not
	their mRNAs, are overproduced in cells expressing the activated kinase
	domain. The inhibition of proliferation is not seen when the activated
	kinase domain is expressed in cells lacking CfaD or AprA or in cells
	that contain a nonphosphorylatable eIF2alpha. We conclude that production
	of the chalones CfaD and AprA is translationally regulated by eIF2alpha
	phosphorylation. Both proteins are upregulated at the culmination
	of development, and this enhanced production is lacking in a strain
	that possesses a nonphosphorylatable eIF2alpha.},

	We found an unexpected role for the clathrin adaptor epsin in regulating

	In Dictyostelium cells, epsin is required for both the membrane recruitment

	pits. Specific residues in the ENTH domain of epsin that are required

	A handful of animals, notably the fungus-growing ants, termites and

	and seeding of food propagules, cultivation of the crop and sustainable
	harvesting. More primitive examples, which could be called husbandry
	because they involve fewer adaptations, include marine snails farming
	intertidal fungi and damselfish farming algae. Recent work has shown
	that microorganisms are surprisingly like animals in having sophisticated
	behaviours such as cooperation, communication and recognition, as
	well as many kinds of symbiosis. Here we show that the social amoeba
	Dictyostelium discoideum has a primitive farming symbiosis that includes
	dispersal and prudent harvesting of the crop. About one-third of
	wild-collected clones engage in husbandry of bacteria. Instead of
	consuming all bacteria in their patch, they stop feeding early and
	incorporate bacteria into their fruiting bodies. They then carry
	bacteria during spore dispersal and can seed a new food crop, which
	is a major advantage if edible bacteria are lacking at the new site.
	However, if they arrive at sites already containing appropriate bacteria,
	the costs of early feeding cessation are not compensated for, which
	may account for the dichotomous nature of this farming symbiosis.
	The striking convergent evolution between bacterial husbandry in
	social amoebas and fungus farming in social insects makes sense because
	multigenerational benefits of farming go to already established kin
	groups.},

	mold Physarum polycephalum. These RNAs are encoded by mitochondrial
	DNA (mtDNA), cosediment with mitoribosomes in glycerol gradients,

	social interactions and development. When starved, free-living amoebae
	aggregate and differentiate into a multicellular fruiting body with
	a dead stalk that holds aloft viable spores. By measuring interactions
	among a set of natural strains, we quantify DGEs, IGEs and GxG epistasis
	affecting spore formation. We find that DGEs explain most of the
	phenotypic variance (57.6%) whereas IGEs explain a smaller (13.3%)
	but highly significant component. Interestingly, GxG epistasis explains
	nearly a quarter of the variance (23.0%), highlighting the complex
	nature of genotype interactions. These results demonstrate the large
	impact that social interactions can have on development and suggest
	that social effects should play an important role in developmental
	evolution in this system.},

	understand the causes of this effect, we examined the transcriptional
	profile of A. baumannii grown in the presence or absence of ethanol
	using RNA-Seq. Using the Illumina/Solexa platform, a total of 43,453,960
	reads (35 nt) were obtained, of which 3,596,474 mapped uniquely to
	the genome. Our analysis revealed that ethanol induces the expression
	of 49 genes that belong to different functional categories. A strong
	induction was observed for genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating
	that ethanol is efficiently assimilated. In addition, we detected
	the induction of genes encoding stress proteins, including upsA,
	hsp90, groEL and lon as well as permeases, efflux pumps and a secreted
	phospholipase C. In stationary phase, ethanol strongly induced several
	genes involved with iron assimilation and a high-affinity phosphate

  abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells provides cell structure
	and organisation, and allows cells to generate forces against membranes.
	As such it is a central component of a variety of cellular structures
	involved in cell motility, cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking. In
	multicellular organisms these processes contribute towards embryonic
	development and effective functioning of cells of all types, most
	obviously rapidly moving cells like lymphocytes. Actin also defines
	and maintains the architecture of complex structures such as neuronal
	synapses and stereocillia, and is required for basic housekeeping
	tasks within the cell. It is therefore not surprising that misregulation
	of the actin cytoskeleton can cause a variety of disease pathologies,
	including compromised immunity, neurodegeneration, and cancer spread.
	Dictyostelium discoideum has long been used as a tool for dissecting
	the mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells migrate and chemotax, and
	recently it has gained precedence as a model organism for studying
	the roles of conserved pathways in disease processes. Dictyostelium's
	unusual lifestyle, positioned between unicellular and multicellular
	organisms, combined with ease of handling and strong conservation
	of actin regulatory machinery with higher animals, make it ideally
	suited for studying actin-related diseases. Here we address how research
	in Dictyostelium has contributed to our understanding of immune deficiencies
	and neurological defects in humans, and briefly discuss its future
	prospects for furthering our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders.},

	the pyrophosphate IP. Initial insights into functions of these substances
	derived primarily from yeast, which contain a single isoform of IP

	functions for inositol pyrophosphates have been investigated by using

	abundance of mRNA transcripts and protein molecules enable genetically
	identical cells to oscillate between several distinct states (Kaern

	physical differences in the genetic code it is termed non-genetic
	heterogeneity. Non-genetic heterogeneity endows cell populations
	with useful capabilities they could never achieve if each cell were
	the same as its neighbors (Raj &amp; van Oudenaarden 2008; Eldar

	phenotypic rescue. Mutation of the essential phosphoryl-accepting
	aspartate in receivers 1, 2, or both had only modest effects on AC
	activity and did not affect phenotypic rescue, indicating that AC
	activity is not critically regulated by phosphorelay. Remarkably,
	the dimerizing histidine phosphoacceptor subdomain, which in ACR
	lacks the canonical histidine for autophosphorylation, was essential

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The uptake of particles by actin-powered invagination
	of the plasma membrane is common to protozoa and to phagocytes involved
	in the immune response of higher organisms. The question addressed
	here is how a phagocyte may use geometric cues to optimize force
	generation for the uptake of a particle. We survey mechanisms that
	enable a phagocyte to remodel actin organization in response to particles
	of complex shape. RESULTS: Using particles that consist of two lobes
	separated by a neck, we found that Dictyostelium cells transmit signals
	concerning the curvature of a surface to the actin system underlying
	the plasma membrane. Force applied to a concave region can divide
	a particle in two, allowing engulfment of the portion first encountered.
	The phagosome membrane that is bent around the concave region is
	marked by a protein containing an inverse Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (I-BAR)
	domain in combination with an Src homology (SH3) domain, similar
	to mammalian insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53. Regulatory
	proteins enable the phagocyte to switch activities within seconds
	in response to particle shape. Ras, an inducer of actin polymerization,
	is activated along the cup surface. Coronin, which limits the lifetime
	of actin structures, is reversibly recruited to the cup, reflecting
	a program of actin depolymerization. The various forms of myosin-I
	are candidate motor proteins for force generation in particle uptake,
	whereas myosin-II is engaged only in retracting a phagocytic cup
	after a switch to particle release. Thus, the constriction of a phagocytic
	cup differs from the contraction of a cleavage furrow in mitosis.
	CONCLUSIONS: Phagocytes scan a particle surface for convex and concave
	regions. By modulating the spatiotemporal pattern of actin organization,
	they are capable of switching between different modes of interaction
	with a particle, either arresting at a concave region and applying
	force in an attempt to sever the particle there, or extending the
	cup along the particle surface to identify the very end of the object
	to be ingested. Our data illustrate the flexibility of regulatory
	mechanisms that are at the phagocyte's disposal in exploring an environment
	of irregular geometry.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The vacuolar H+-ATPase, or V-ATPase, is a highly-conserved
	multi-subunit enzyme that transports protons across membranes at
	the expense of ATP. The resulting proton gradient serves many essential
	functions, among them energizing transport of small molecules such
	as neurotransmitters, and acidifying organelles such as endosomes.
	The enzyme is not present in the plasma membrane from which a phagosome
	is formed, but is rapidly delivered by fusion with endosomes that
	already bear the V-ATPase in their membranes. Similarly, the enzyme
	is thought to be retrieved from phagosome membranes prior to exocytosis
	of indigestible material, although that process has not been directly
	visualized. METHODOLOGY: To monitor trafficking of the V-ATPase in
	the phagocytic pathway of Dictyostelium discoideum, we fed the cells
	yeast, large particles that maintain their shape during trafficking.
	To track pH changes, we conjugated the yeast with fluorescein isothiocyanate.
	Cells were labeled with VatM-GFP, a fluorescently-tagged transmembrane
	subunit of the V-ATPase, in parallel with stage-specific endosomal
	markers or in combination with mRFP-tagged cytoskeletal proteins.
	PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We find that the V-ATPase is commonly retrieved
	from the phagosome membrane by vesiculation shortly before exocytosis.
	However, if the cells are kept in confined spaces, a bulky phagosome
	may be exocytosed prematurely. In this event, a large V-ATPase-rich
	vacuole coated with actin typically separates from the acidic phagosome
	shortly before exocytosis. This vacuole is propelled by an actin
	tail and soon acquires the properties of an early endosome, revealing
	an unexpected mechanism for rapid recycling of the V-ATPase. Any
	V-ATPase that reaches the plasma membrane is also promptly retrieved.
	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, live cell microscopy has revealed
	both a usual route and alternative means of recycling the V-ATPase
	in the endocytic pathway.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the genesis of many tissues, a phase of cell proliferation
	is followed by cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. The
	latter two processes overlap: genes involved in the cessation of
	growth may also be important in triggering differentiation. Though
	conceptually distinct, they are often causally related and functional
	interactions between the cell cycle machinery and cell fate control
	networks are fundamental to coordinate growth and differentiation.
	A switch from proliferation to differentiation may also be important
	in the life cycle of single-celled organisms, and genes which arose
	as regulators of microbial differentiation may be conserved in higher
	organisms. Studies in microorganisms may thus contribute to understanding
	the molecular links between cell cycle machinery and the determination
	of cell fate choice networks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here
	we show that in the amoebozoan D. discoideum, an ortholog of the
	metazoan antiproliferative gene btg controls cell fate, and that
	this function is dependent on the presence of a second tumor suppressor
	ortholog, the retinoblastoma-like gene product. Specifically, we
	find that btg-overexpressing cells preferentially adopt a stalk cell
	(and, more particularly, an Anterior-Like Cell) fate. No btg-dependent
	preference for ALC fate is observed in cells in which the retinoblastoma-like
	gene has been genetically inactivated. Dictyostelium btg is the only
	example of non-metazoan member of the BTG family characterized so
	far, suggesting that a genetic interaction between btg and Rb predated
	the divergence between dictyostelids and metazoa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	While the requirement for retinoblastoma function for BTG antiproliferative
	activity in metazoans is known, an interaction of these genes in
	the control of cell fate has not been previously documented. Involvement
	of a single pathway in the control of mutually exclusive processes
	may have relevant implication in the evolution of multicellularity.},

	ADP-ribose (PAR) polymerases (PARPs) is an early response to DNA
	double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this paper, we exploit Dictyostelium
	discoideum to uncover a novel role for PARylation in regulating nonhomologous
	end joining (NHEJ). PARylation occurred at single-strand breaks,
	and two PARPs, Adprt1b and Adprt2, were required for resistance to
	this kind of DNA damage. In contrast, although Adprt1b was dispensable
	for PARylation at DSBs, Adprt1a and, to a lesser extent, Adprt2 were
	required for this event. Disruption of adprt2 had a subtle impact
	on the ability of cells to perform NHEJ. However, disruption of adprt1a
	decreased the ability of cells to perform end joining with a concomitant
	increase in homologous recombination. PAR-dependent regulation of
	NHEJ was achieved through promoting recruitment and/or retention
	of Ku at DSBs. Furthermore, a PAR interaction motif in Ku70 was required
	for this regulation and efficient NHEJ. These data illustrate that
	PARylation at DSBs promotes NHEJ through recruitment or retention
	of repair factors at sites of DNA damage.},

  abstract = {We investigated the conservation and antibody accessibility of inner
	core epitopes of Moraxella catarrhalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in
	order to assess their potential as vaccine candidates. Two LPS mutants,
	a single mutant designated lgt2 and a double mutant termed lgt2/lgt4,
	elaborating truncated inner core structures were generated in order
	to preclude expression of host-like outer core structures and to
	create an inner core structure that was shared by all three serotypes
	A, B and C of M. catarrhalis. Murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),
	designated MC2-1 and MC2-10 were obtained by immunising mice with
	the lgt2 mutant of M. catarrhalis serotype A strain. We showed that
	mAb MC2-1 can bind to the core LPS of wild-type (wt) serotype A,
	B and C organisms and concluded that mAb MC2-1 defines an immunogenic
	inner core epitope of M. catarrhalis LPS. We were unsuccessful in
	obtaining mAbs to the lgt2/lgt4 mutant. MAb MC2-10 only recognised
	the lgt2 mutant and the wt serotype A strain, and exhibited a strong
	requirement for the terminal N-acetyl-glucosamine residue of the
	lgt2 mutant core oligosaccharide, suggesting that this residue was
	immunodominant. Subsequently, we showed that both mAbs MC2-1 and
	MC2-10 could facilitate bactericidal killing of the lgt2 mutant,
	however neither mAb could facilitate bactericidal killing of the
	wt serotype A strain. We then confirmed and extended the candidacy
	of the inner core LPS by demonstrating that it is possible to elicit
	functional antibodies against M. catarrhalis wt strains following
	immunisation of rabbits with glycoconjugates elaborating the conserved
	inner core LPS antigen. The present study describes three conjugation
	strategies that either uses amidases produced by Dictyostelium discoideum,
	targeting the amino functionality created by the amidase activity
	as the attachment point on the LPS molecule, or a strong base treatment
	to remove all fatty acids from the LPS, thus creating amino functionalities
	in the lipid A region to conjugate via maleimide-thiol linker strategies
	targeting the carboxyl residues of the carrier protein and the free
	amino functionalities of the derived lipid A region of the carbohydrate
	resulted in a high loading of carbohydrates per carrier protein from
	these carbohydrate preparations. Immunisation derived antisera from
	rabbits recognised fully extended M. catarrhalis LPS and whole cells.
	Moreover, bactericidal activity was demonstrated to both the immunising
	carbohydrate antigen and importantly to wt cells, thus further supporting
	the consideration of inner core LPS as a potential vaccine antigen
	to combat disease caused by M. catarrhalis.},

	lipopolysaccharide (LPS-OH) via direct reductive amination between
	the reducing end of the oligosaccharide molecule, created by treatment
	with alkaline phosphatase, and amino functionalities on the CRM(197)
	carrier protein. These glycoconjugates proved difficult to prepare
	because the presence of amide linked fatty-acyl groups results in
	glycolipids that are relatively insoluble and aggregate. Therefore,
	we have examined several strategies to prepare glycoconjugates in
	order to identify a robust, consistently reproducible strategy that
	produces glycoconjugates with a high loading of LPS derived oligosaccharides.
	Initially we used completely deacylated LPS molecules, but lacking
	phosphoethanolamine (PEtn) from the core OS as the strong basic conditions
	required to completely deacylate the LPS would modify the PEtn residue.
	We utilised a squarate linker and conjugated via the reducing end
	of the carbohydrate antigen following removal of the glycosidic phosphate
	to amino groups on CRM(197), however carbohydrate loading on the
	carrier protein was low. Glycoconjugates were then produced utilising
	amidases produced by Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), which partially
	remove N-linked fatty acids from the lipid A region of the Nm LPS
	molecule, which enabled the retention of the PEtn residue. LPS-OH
	was treated with Dd amidase, the reducing glycosidic phosphate removed,
	and using a cystamine linker strategy, conjugated to the carrier
	protein. Carbohydrate loading was somewhat improved but still not
	high. Finally, we have developed a novel conjugation strategy that
	targets the amino functionality created by the amidase activity as
	the attachment point. The amino functionality on the PEtn residue
	of the inner core was protected via a novel blocking and unblocking
	strategy with t-butyl oxycarbonyl. A maleimide-thiol linker strategy,
	targeting lysine residues on the carrier protein did not result in
	high loading of the carbohydrate molecules, however when we targeted
	the carboxyl residues we have consistently obtained a high loading

	a member of the atypical alpha-kinase family, phosphorylates sites
	in the myosin II tail that block filament assembly. Here we show
	that the catalytic activity of A-CAT, the alpha-kinase domain of
	MHCK A (residues 552-841), is severely inhibited by the removal of
	a disordered C-terminal tail sequence (C-tail; residues 806-841).
	The key residue in the C-tail was identified as Thr(825), which was
	found to be constitutively autophosphorylated. Dephosphorylation
	of Thr(825) using shrimp alkaline phosphatase decreased A-CAT activity.
	The activity of a truncated A-CAT lacking Thr(825) could be rescued
	by P(i), phosphothreonine, and a phosphorylated peptide, but not
	by threonine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or an unphosphorylated
	peptide. These results focused attention on a P(i)-binding pocket
	located in the C-terminal lobe of A-CAT. Mutational analysis demonstrated
	that the P(i)-pocket was essential for A-CAT activity. Based on these
	results, it is proposed that autophosphorylation of Thr(825) activates
	ACAT by providing a covalently tethered ligand for the P(i)-pocket.
	Ab initio modeling studies using the Rosetta FloppyTail and FlexPepDock
	protocols showed that it is feasible for the phosphorylated Thr(825)
	to dock intramolecularly into the P(i)-pocket. Allosteric activation
	is predicted to involve a conformational change in Arg(734), which
	bridges the bound P(i) to Asp(762) in a key active site loop. Sequence
	alignments indicate that a comparable regulatory mechanism is likely
	to be conserved in Dictyostelium MHCK B-D and metazoan eukaryotic
	elongation factor-2 kinases.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental work involving Dictyostelium discoideum seems
	to contradict several theoretical models. Experiments suggest that
	localization of the release of the chemoattractant cyclic adenosine
	monophosphate to the uropod of the cell is important for stream formation
	during aggregation. Yet several mathematical models are able to reproduce
	streaming as the cells aggregate without taking into account localization
	of the chemoattractant. A careful analysis of the experiments and
	the theory suggests the two major features of the system which are
	important to stream formation are random cell motion and chemotaxis
	to regions of higher cell density. Random cell motion acts to reduce
	streaming, whereas chemotaxis to regions of higher cell density reinforces
	streaming. With this understanding, the experimental results can
	be explained in a manner consistent with the theoretical results.
	In all the experiments, alterations in the two main factors of random
	motion and chemotaxis to regions of higher cell density, not the
	localization of the release of the chemoattractant, can explain the
	results as they relate to streaming. Additionally, a comparison of
	results from a mathematical model that simulates cells which localize
	the chemoattractant and cells which do not shows little difference
	in the streaming patterns.},

	actin cytoskeleton reorganization (e.g. during cellular adhesion
	or migration). ForC contains formin homology 2 and 3 (FH2 and -3)
	domains and an N-terminal putative GTPase-binding domain (GBD) but
	lacks a canonical FH1 region. To better understand the role of the
	GBD, its structure, dynamics, lipid-binding properties, and cellular
	functions were analyzed by NMR and CD spectroscopy and by in vivo
	fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, the program CS-Rosetta was tested
	for the structure prediction based on chemical shift data only. The
	ForC GBD adopts an ubiquitin-like alpha/beta-roll fold with an unusually
	long loop between beta-strands 1 and 2. Based on the lipid-binding
	data, the presence of DPC micelles induces the formation of alpha-helical
	secondary structure and a rearrangement of the tertiary structure.
	Lipid-binding studies with a mutant protein and a peptide suggest
	that the beta1-beta2 loop is not relevant for these conformational
	changes. Whereas small amounts of negatively charged phosphoinositides
	(1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and
	1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate))
	lower the micelle concentration necessary to induce the observed
	spectral changes, other negatively charged phospholipids (1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-L-serine)
	and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol)) had no
	such effect. Interestingly, bicelles and micelles composed of diacylphosphocholines
	had no effect on the GBD structure. Our data suggest a model in which
	part of the large positively charged surface area of the GBD mediates
	localization to specific membrane patches, thereby regulating interactions
	with signaling proteins. Our cellular localization studies show that
	both the GBD and the FH3 domain are required for ForC targeting to
	cell-cell contacts and early phagocytic cups and macropinosomes.},

	1, which initiates a signaling cascade leading to the activation
	of adenylyl cyclase A (ACA), the synthesis and secretion of additional
	cAMP, and an autocrine and paracrine activation loop. The release
	of cAMP allows neighboring cells to polarize and migrate directionally
	and form characteristic chains of cells called streams. We now report
	that cAMP relay can be measured biochemically by assessing ACA, ERK2,
	and TORC2 activities at successive time points in development after
	stimulating cells with subsaturating concentrations of cAMP. We also
	find that the activation profiles of ACA, ERK2, and TORC2 change
	in the course of development, with later developed cells showing
	a loss of sensitivity to the relayed signal. We examined mutants
	in PKA activity that have been associated with precocious development
	and find that this loss in responsiveness occurs earlier in these
	mutants. Remarkably, we show that this loss in sensitivity correlates
	with a switch in migration patterns as cells transition from streams
	to aggregates. We propose that as cells proceed through development,
	the cAMP-induced desensitization and down-regulation of cAMP receptor
	1 impacts the sensitivities of chemotactic signaling cascades leading

	do not observe any temporal relationship between protrusions and

	to the centromeres and thus ensures correct chromosome segregation
	during mitosis and meiosis. The Dictyostelium H3-like variant H3v1
	was identified as the CenH3 ortholog. Dictyostelium CenH3 has an
	extended N-terminal domain with no similarity to any other known
	proteins and a histone fold domain at its C-terminus. Within the
	histone fold, alpha-helix 2 (alpha2) and an extended loop 1 (L1)
	have been shown to be required for targeting CenH3 to centromeres.
	Compared to other known and putative CenH3 histones, Dictyostelium
	CenH3 has a shorter L1, suggesting that the extension is not an obligatory
	feature. Through ChIP analysis and fluorescence microscopy of live
	and fixed cells, we provide here the first survey of centromere structure
	in amoebozoa. The six telocentric centromeres were found to mostly
	consist of all the DIRS-1 elements and to associate with H3K9me3.
	During interphase, the centromeres remain attached to the centrosome
	forming a single CenH3-containing cluster. Loading of Dictyostelium
	CenH3 onto centromeres occurs at the G2/prophase transition, in contrast
	to the anaphase/telophase loading of CenH3 observed in metazoans.
	This suggests that loading during G2/prophase is the ancestral eukaryotic
	mechanism and that anaphase/telophase loading of CenH3 has evolved
	more recently after the amoebozoa diverged from the animal linage.},

	of the head region to the antagonist action of NF449 and suramin
	at the human P2X1 receptor. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Chimeras and point
	mutations in the cysteine-rich head region were made between human
	P2X1 and P2X2 receptors. Mutant receptors were expressed in Xenopus
	oocytes and P2X receptor currents characterized using two-electrode
	voltage clamp. KEY RESULTS: The chimera replacing the region between
	the third and fourth conserved cysteine residues of the P2X1 receptor
	with the corresponding part of P2X2 reduced NF449 sensitivity a thousand
	fold from an IC(50) of approximately 1 nM at the P2X1 receptor to
	that of the P2X2 receptor (IC(50) approximately 1 microM). A similar
	decrease in sensitivity resulted from mutation of four positively
	charged P2X1 receptor residues in this region that are absent from
	the P2X2 receptor. These chimeras and mutations were also involved
	in determining sensitivity to the antagonist suramin. Reciprocal
	chimeras and mutations in the P2X2 receptor produced modest increases
	in antagonist sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data
	indicate that a cluster of positively charged residues at the base
	of the cysteine-rich head region can account for the highly selective
	antagonism of the P2X1 receptor by the suramin derivative NF449.},

	In mammalian hepatocytes, VPA increases lipid droplet accumulation

	Using (3)H-labelled polyunsaturated (arachidonic) or saturated (palmitic)

	phosphatidylethanolamine and non-polar lipids in this time period,

	Since fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can measure the

	allows us to determine the dynamics and hence indirectly the structural
	properties of the cytoskeleton components with high spatial resolution.
	To this end we investigate the FCS signal of GFP-actin in living
	Dictyostelium discoideum cells and explore the inherent spatial and
	temporal signatures of the actin cytoskeleton. Using the free green
	fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reference, we find that actin diffusion

	diluted cell extract. The FCS signal in the dense cortical F-actin
	network near the cell membrane is probed using the cytoskeleton protein
	LIM and is found to be slower than cytosolic G-actin diffusion. Furthermore,
	we show that polymerization of the cytoskeleton induced by Jasplakinolide
	leads to a substantial decrease of G-actin diffusion. Pronounced
	fluctuations in the distribution of the FCS correlation curves can
	be induced by latrunculin, which is known to induce actin waves.
	Our work suggests that the FCS signal of GFP-actin in combination

	where they act as key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. To monitor
	the dynamics of activated Rac1 in Dictyostelium cells, a fluorescent
	probe was developed that specifically binds to the GTP-bound form
	of Rac1. The probe is based on the GTPase-binding domain (GBD) from
	PAK1 kinase, and was selected on the basis of yeast two-hybrid, GST
	pull-down and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays. The
	PAK1 GBD localizes to leading edges of migrating cells and to endocytotic
	cups. Similarly to its role in vertebrates, activated Rac1 therefore
	appears to control de novo actin polymerization at protruding regions
	of the Dictyostelium cell. Additionally, we found that the IQGAP-related
	protein DGAP1, which sequesters active Rac1 into a quaternary complex
	with actin-binding proteins cortexillin I and cortexillin II, localizes
	to the trailing regions of migrating cells. Notably, PAK1 GBD and
	DGAP1, which both bind to Rac1-GTP, display mutually exclusive localizations
	in cell migration, phagocytosis and cytokinesis, and opposite dynamics
	of recruitment to the cell cortex upon stimulation with chemoattractants.
	Moreover, cortical localization of the PAK1 GBD depends on the integrity
	of the actin cytoskeleton, whereas cortical localization of DGAP1
	does not. Taken together, these results imply that Rac1 GTPases play
	a dual role in regulation of cell motility and polarity in Dictyostelium.},

	in the same conditions that wild-type slugs exhibited positive phototaxis

	surprisingly low levels of nucleotide variation in D. discoideum

	We also do not find any clear relationship between nucleotide divergence

	Kin discrimination experiments, however, show that strains collected
	from the same location show greater ability to distinguish self from
	non-self than do strains from different geographic areas. This suggests
	that a greater ability to recognize self versus non-self may arise
	among strains that are more likely to encounter each other in nature,
	which would lead to preferential formation of fruiting bodies with
	clonemates and may prevent the evolution of cheating behaviors within

	rarely been observed in this species, we document a rapid decay of
	linkage disequilibrium between SNPs, the presence of recombinant

	recombination parameter rho. The SNP data indicate that recombination

	respiratory complexes, the disease phenotypes are mediated by chronic

	kinase (AMPK). This chronic AMPK hyperactivity maintains mitochondrial
	mass and cellular ATP concentrations at normal levels, but chronically
	impairs growth, cell cycle progression, multicellular development,
	photosensory and thermosensory signal transduction. It also causes
	the cells to support greater proliferation of the intracellular bacterial
	pathogen, Legionella pneumophila. Notably however, phagocytic and
	macropinocytic nutrient uptake are impervious both to AMPK signalling
	and to these types of mitochondrial dysfunction. Surprisingly, a
	Complex I-specific deficiency (midA knockout) not only causes the
	foregoing AMPK-mediated defects, but also produces a dramatic deficit
	in endocytic nutrient uptake accompanied by an additional secondary
	defect in growth. More restricted and specific phenotypic outcomes
	are produced by knocking out genes for nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
	proteins that are not required for respiration. The Dictyostelium
	model for mitochondrial disease has thus revealed consistent patterns
	of sublethal dysregulation of intracellular signalling pathways that

  abstract = {The sole gateway for molecular exchange between the cytoplasm and
	the nucleus is the nuclear pore complex (NPC). This large supramolecular
	assembly mediates transport of cargo into and out of the nucleus
	and fuse the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form an aqueous
	translocation channel. The NPC is composed of eight proteinaceous
	asymmetric units forming a pseudo-8-fold symmetric passage. Due to
	its shear size, complexity, and plastic nature, dissecting the high-resolution
	three-dimensional structure of the NPC in its hydrated state is a
	formidable challenge. Toward this goal, we applied cryo-electron
	tomography to spread nuclear envelopes from Xenopus oocytes. To compensate
	for perturbations of the 8-fold symmetry of individual NPCs, we performed
	symmetry-independent asymmetric unit averaging of three-dimensional
	tomographic NPC volumes to eventually yield a refined model at 6.4
	nm resolution. This approach revealed novel structural features,
	particularly in the spoke-ring complex and luminal domains. Fused
	concentric ring architecture of the spoke-ring complex was found
	along the translocation channel. Additionally, a comparison of the
	refined Xenopus model to that of its Dictyostelium homologue yielded
	similar pore diameters at the level of the three canonical rings,
	although the Xenopus NPC was found to be 30% taller than the Dictyostelium
	pore. This discrepancy is attributed primarily to the relatively
	low homology and different organization of some nucleoporins in the
	Dictyostelium genome as compared to that of vertebrates. Nevertheless,
	the experimental conditions impose a preferred axial orientation
	of the NPCs within spread Xenopus oocyte nuclear envelopes. This
	may at least in part explain the increased height of the reconstructed
	vertebrate NPCs compared to those obtained from tomographic reconstruction
	of intact Dictyostelium nuclei.},

	that regulates aggregation, cell differentiation and morphogenesis
	during multi-cellular development of the social amoeba Dictyostelium
	discoideum. This molecule is produced by three different adenylyl
	cyclases, encoded by the genes acaA, acrA and acgA, expressed at
	different stages of development and in different structures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: This article describes the characterization of the promoter
	region of the acaA gene, showing that it is transcribed from three
	different alternative promoters. The distal promoter, promoter 1,
	is active during the aggregation process while the more proximal
	promoters are active in tip-organiser and posterior regions of the
	structures. A DNA fragment containing the three promoters drove expression
	to these same regions and similar results were obtained by in situ
	hybridization. Analyses of mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR
	with specific primers for each of the three transcripts also demonstrated
	their different temporal patterns of expression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	The existence of an aggregation-specific promoter can be associated
	with the use of cAMP as chemo-attractant molecule, which is specific
	for some Dictyostelium species. Expression at late developmental
	stages indicates that adenylyl cyclase A might play a more important
	role in post-aggregative development than previously considered.},

	of Dictyostelium cells with a defined V(m) using these three techniques.
	The directionality (directedness of electrotaxis) was quantified
	and compared to that of chemotaxis (chemotactic index). We found
	that a reduced V(m) significantly impaired electrotaxis without significantly
	affecting random motility or chemotaxis. We conclude that extracellular
	pH, [K(+)], and electroporation all significantly affected electrotaxis,
	which appeared to be mediated by the changes in V(m). The initial
	directional sensing mechanisms for electrotaxis therefore differ
	from those of chemotaxis and may be mediated by changes in resting
	V(m).},

	at the cytoplasmic face and back of the wave. Coronin is a marker

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a motile polarized cell the actin system is differentiated
	to allow protrusion at the front and retraction at the tail. This
	differentiation is linked to the phosphoinositide pattern in the
	plasma membrane. In the highly motile Dictyostelium cells studied
	here, the front is dominated by PI3-kinases producing PI(3,4,5)tris-phosphate
	(PIP3), the tail by the PI3-phosphatase PTEN that hydrolyses PIP3
	to PI(4,5)bis-phosphate. To study de-novo cell polarization, we first
	depolymerized actin and subsequently recorded the spontaneous reorganization
	of actin patterns in relation to PTEN. RESULTS: In a transient stage
	of recovery from depolymerization, symmetric actin patterns alternate
	periodically with asymmetric ones. The switches to asymmetry coincide
	with the unilateral membrane-binding of PTEN. The modes of state
	transitions in the actin and PTEN systems differ. Transitions in
	the actin system propagate as waves that are initiated at single
	sites by the amplification of spontaneous fluctuations. In PTEN-null
	cells, these waves still propagate with normal speed but loose their
	regular periodicity. Membrane-binding of PTEN is induced at the border
	of a coherent PTEN-rich area in the form of expanding and regressing
	gradients. CONCLUSIONS: The state transitions in actin organization
	and the reversible transition from cytoplasmic to membrane-bound
	PTEN are synchronized but their patterns differ. The transitions
	in actin organization are independent of PTEN, but when PTEN is present,
	they are coupled to periodic changes in the membrane-binding of this
	PIP3-degrading phosphatase. The PTEN oscillations are related to
	motility patterns of chemotaxing cells.},

	signaling molecules that accumulate and once a critical concentration

	in a process termed quorum sensing (QS). In the social amoeba Dictyostelium
	discoideum, QS plays an important role during development. However
	little is known about its effect on cell migration especially in
	the growth phase. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To investigate the role of
	cell density on cell migration in the growth phase, we use multisite
	timelapse microscopy and automated cell tracking. This analysis reveals
	a high heterogeneity within a given cell population, and the necessity
	to use large data sets to draw reliable conclusions on cell motion.
	In average, motion is persistent for short periods of time (t &lt;/=
	5 min), but normal diffusive behavior is recovered over longer time
	periods. The persistence times are positively correlated with the
	migrated distances. Interestingly, the migrated distance decreases
	as well with cell density. The adaptation of cell migration to cell
	density highlights the role of a secreted quorum sensing factor (QSF)
	on cell migration. Using a simple model describing the balance between
	the rate of QSF generation and the rate of QSF dilution, we were
	able to gather all experimental results into a single master curve,
	showing a sharp cell transition between high and low motile behaviors
	with increasing QSF. CONCLUSION: This study unambiguously demonstrates
	the central role played by QSF on amoeboid motion in the growth phase.},

	systems used to study how cells count themselves to determine the
	number and/or density of cells. In this review, we describe work
	on three different cell-density sensing systems used by Dictyostelium.
	The first involves a negative feedback loop in which two secreted
	signals inhibit cell proliferation during the growth phase. As the
	cell density increases, the concentrations of the secreted factors
	concomitantly increase, allowing the cells to sense their density.
	The two signals act as message authenticators for each other, and
	the existence of two different signals that require each other for
	activity may explain why previous efforts to identify autocrine proliferation-inhibiting
	signals in higher eukaryotes have generally failed. The second system
	involves a signal made by growing cells that is secreted only when
	they starve. This then allows cells to sense the density of just
	the starving cells, and is an example of a mechanism that allows
	cells in a tissue to sense the density of one specific cell type.
	The third cell density counting system involves cells in aggregation
	streams secreting a signal that limits the size of fruiting bodies.
	Computer simulations predicted, and experiments then showed, that
	the factor increases random cell motility and decreases cell-cell
	adhesion to cause streams to break up if there are too many cells
	in the stream. Together, studies on Dictyostelium cell density counting
	systems will help elucidate how higher eukaryotes regulate the size
	and composition of tissues.},

	processes is well characterized, but their role during endo-phagosomal
	membrane trafficking and maturation is less clear. In Dictyostelium,
	knockout of myosin IB (myoB) leads to a defect in membrane protein
	recycling from endosomes back to the plasma membrane. Here, we show
	that actin plays a central role in the morphology and function of
	the endocytic pathway. Indeed, latrunculin B (LatB) induces endosome
	tubulation, a phenotype also observed in dynamin A (dymA)-null cells.
	Knockout of dymA impairs phagosome acidification, whereas knockout
	of myoB delays reneutralization, a phenotype mimicked by a low dose
	of LatB. As a read out for actin-dependent processes during maturation,
	we monitored the capacity of purified phagosomes to bind F-actin
	in vitro, and correlated this with the presence of actin-binding
	and membrane-trafficking proteins. Phagosomes isolated from myoB-null
	cells showed an increased binding to F-actin, especially late phagosomes.
	In contrast, early phagosomes from dymA-null cells showed reduced

  abstract = {Pre-starvation amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum exhibit random
	movements. Starved cells aggregate by directed movements (chemotaxis)
	towards cyclic AMP and differentiate into live spores or dead stalk
	cells. Many differences between presumptive spore and stalk cells
	precede differentiation. We have examined whether cell motility-related
	factors are also among them. Cell speeds and localisation of motility-related
	signalling molecules were monitored by live cell imaging and immunostaining
	(a) in nutrient medium during growth, (b) immediately following transfer
	to starvation medium and (c) in nutrient medium that was re-introduced
	after a brief period of starvation. Cells moved randomly under all
	three conditions but mean speeds increased following transfer from
	nutrient medium to starvation medium; the transition occurred within
	15 min. The distribution of speeds in starvation medium was bimodal:
	about 20% of the cells moved significantly faster than the remaining
	80%. The motility-related molecules F-actin, PTEN and PI3 kinase
	were distributed differently in slow and fast cells. Among starved
	cells, the calcium content of slower cells was lower than that of
	the faster cells. All differences reverted within 15 min after restoration
	of the nutrient medium. The slow/fast distinction was missing in
	Polysphondylium pallidum, a cellular slime mould that lacks the presumptive
	stalk and spore cell classes, and in the trishanku (triA(-)) mutant
	of D. discoideum, in which the classes exist but are unstable. The
	transition from growth to starvation triggers a spontaneous and reversible
	switch in the distribution of D. discoideum cell speeds. Cells whose
	calcium content is relatively low (known to be presumptive spore
	cells) move slower than those whose calcium levels are higher (known
	to be presumptive stalk cells). Slow and fast cells show different
	distributions of motility-related proteins. The switch is indicative
	of a bistable mechanism underlying cell motility.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cdk8 is a component of the mediator complex which facilitates
	transcription by RNA polymerase II and has been shown to play an
	important role in development of Dictyostelium discoideum. This eukaryote
	feeds as single cells but starvation triggers the formation of a
	multicellular organism in response to extracellular pulses of cAMP
	and the eventual generation of spores. Strains in which the gene
	encoding Cdk8 have been disrupted fail to form multicellular aggregates
	unless supplied with exogenous pulses of cAMP and later in development,
	cdk8- cells show a defect in spore production. RESULTS: Microarray
	analysis revealed that the cdk8- strain previously described (cdk8-HL)
	contained genome duplications. Regeneration of the strain in a background
	lacking detectable gene duplication generated strains (cdk8-2) with
	identical defects in growth and early development, but a milder defect
	in spore generation, suggesting that the severity of this defect
	depends on the genetic background. The failure of cdk8- cells to
	aggregate unless rescued by exogenous pulses of cAMP is consistent
	with a failure to express the catalytic subunit of protein kinase
	A. However, overexpression of the gene encoding this protein was
	not sufficient to rescue the defect, suggesting that this is not
	the only important target for Cdk8 at this stage of development.
	Proteomic analysis revealed two potential targets for Cdk8 regulation,
	one regulated post-transcriptionally (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
	(HPD)) and one transcriptionally (short chain dehydrogenase/reductase
	(SDR1)). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis has confirmed the importance
	of Cdk8 at multiple stages of Dictyostelium development, although
	the severity of the defect in spore production depends on the genetic
	background. Potential targets of Cdk8-mediated gene regulation have
	been identified in Dictyostelium which will allow the mechanism of
	Cdk8 action and its role in development to be determined.},

	complex which links the basal transcription machinery to regulatory
	proteins. The pair are required for correct regulation of a subset
	of genes and have been implicated in control of development in a
	number of organisms including the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum.
	When feeding, Dictyostelium amoebae are unicellular but upon starvation
	they aggregate to form a multicellular structure which develops into
	a fruiting body containing spores. Cells in which the gene encoding
	Cdk8 has been deleted fail to enter aggregates due to a failure of
	early gene expression. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have monitored the
	expression levels of cyclin C protein during development and find
	levels decrease after the multicellular mound is formed. This decrease
	is triggered by extracellular cAMP that, in turn, is working in part
	through an increase in intracellular cAMP. The loss of cyclin C is
	coincident with a reduction in the association of Cdk8 with a high
	molecular weight complex in the nucleus. Overexpression of cyclin
	C and Cdk8 lead to an increased rate of early development, consistent
	with the levels being rate limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Overall these results
	show that both cyclin C and Cdk8 are regulated during development
	in response to extracellular signals and the levels of these proteins
	are important in controlling the timing of developmental processes.
	These findings have important implications for the role of these
	proteins in controlling development, suggesting that they are targets
	for developmental signals to regulate gene expression.},

	development, immune response, and metastasis. Cells move either spontaneously,
	in a nondirected fashion, or in response to chemotactic signals,
	in a directed fashion. Even though they are often studied separately,
	both forms of motility share many complex processes at the molecular
	and subcellular scale, e.g., orchestrated cytoskeletal rearrangements
	and polarization. In addition, at the cellular level both types of
	motility include persistent runs interspersed with reorientation
	pauses. Because there is a great range of variability in motility
	among different cell types, a key challenge in the field is to integrate
	these multiscale processes into a coherent framework. We analyzed
	the motility of Dictyostelium cells with bimodal analysis, a method
	that compares time spent in persistent versus reorientation mode.
	Unexpectedly, we found that reorientation time is coupled with persistent
	time in an inverse correlation and, surprisingly, the inverse correlation
	holds for both nondirected and chemotactic motility, so that the
	full range of Dictyostelium motility can be described by a single
	scaling relationship. Additionally, we found an identical scaling
	relationship for three human cell lines, indicating that the coupling
	of reorientation and persistence holds across species and making
	it possible to describe the complexity of cell motility in a surprisingly
	general and simple manner. With this new perspective, we analyzed
	the motility of Dictyostelium mutants, and found four in which the
	coupling between two modes was altered. Our results point to a fundamental
	underlying principle, described by a simple scaling law, unifying

	in the regulation of receptor-dependent intracellular signaling and
	their trafficking. The arrestin superfamilly includes several arrestin
	domain-containing proteins and the structurally related protein Vps26.
	In Dictyostelium discoideum, the arrestin-domain containing proteins
	form a family of six members, namely AdcA to -F. In contrast to canonical
	arrestins, Dictyostelium Adc proteins show a more complex architecture,
	as they possess, in addition to the arrestin core, other domains,
	such as C2, FYVE, LIM, MIT and SAM, which potentially mediate selective
	interactions with either lipids or proteins. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: A detailed analysis of AdcA has been performed. AdcA extends
	on both sides of the arrestin core, in particular by a FYVE domain
	which mediates selective interactions with PI(3)P, as disclosed by
	intrinsic fluorescence measurements and lipid overlay assays. Localization
	studies showed an enrichment of tagged- and endogenous AdcA on the
	rim of early macropinosomes and phagosomes. This vesicular distribution
	relies on a functional FYVE domain. Our data also show that the arrestin
	core binds the ADP-ribosylation factor ArfA, the unique amoebal Arf
	member, in its GDP-bound conformation. SIGNIFICANCE: This work describes
	one of the 6 arrestin domain-containing proteins of Dictyostelium,
	a novel and atypical member of the arrestin clan. It provides the
	basis for a better understanding of arrestin-related protein involvement
	in trafficking processes and for further studies on the expanding

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) domain is widely conserved among
	eukaryotic proteins. In Zic/Gli/Zap1 C2H2 ZF proteins, the two N-terminal
	ZFs form a single structural unit by sharing a hydrophobic core.
	This structural unit defines a new motif comprised of two tryptophan
	side chains at the center of the hydrophobic core. Because each tryptophan
	residue is located between the two cysteine residues of the C2H2
	motif, we have named this structure the tandem CWCH2 (tCWCH2) motif.
	RESULTS: Here, we characterized 587 tCWCH2-containing genes using
	data derived from public databases. We categorized genes into 11
	classes including Zic/Gli/Glis, Arid2/Rsc9, PacC, Mizf, Aebp2, Zap1/ZafA,
	Fungl, Zfp106, Twincl, Clr1, and Fungl-4ZF, based on sequence similarity,
	domain organization, and functional similarities. tCWCH2 motifs are
	mostly found in organisms belonging to the Opisthokonta (metazoa,
	fungi, and choanoflagellates) and Amoebozoa (amoeba, Dictyostelium
	discoideum). By comparison, the C2H2 ZF motif is distributed widely
	among the eukaryotes. The structure and organization of the tCWCH2
	motif, its phylogenetic distribution, and molecular phylogenetic
	analysis suggest that prototypical tCWCH2 genes existed in the Opisthokonta
	ancestor. Within-group or between-group comparisons of the tCWCH2
	amino acid sequence identified three additional sequence features
	(site-specific amino acid frequencies, longer linker sequence between
	two C2H2 ZFs, and frequent extra-sequences within C2H2 ZF motifs).
	CONCLUSION: These features suggest that the tCWCH2 motif is a specialized
	motif involved in inter-zinc finger interactions.},

  abstract = {Many eukaryotic cells are able to crawl on surfaces and guide their
	motility based on environmental cues. These cues are interpreted
	by signaling systems which couple to cell mechanics; indeed membrane
	protrusions in crawling cells are often accompanied by activated
	membrane patches, which are localized areas of increased concentration
	of one or more signaling components. To determine how these patches
	are related to cell motion, we examine the spatial localization of
	RasGTP in chemotaxing Dictyostelium discoideum cells under conditions
	where the vertical extent of the cell was restricted. Quantitative
	analyses of the data reveal a high degree of spatial correlation
	between patches of activated Ras and membrane protrusions. Based
	on these findings, we formulate a model for amoeboid cell motion
	that consists of two coupled modules. The first module utilizes a
	recently developed two-component reaction diffusion model that generates
	transient and localized areas of elevated concentration of one of
	the components along the membrane. The activated patches determine
	the location of membrane protrusions (and overall cell motion) that
	are computed in the second module, which also takes into account
	the cortical tension and the availability of protrusion resources.
	We show that our model is able to produce realistic amoeboid-like
	motion and that our numerical results are consistent with experimentally
	observed pseudopod dynamics. Specifically, we show that the commonly
	observed splitting of pseudopods can result directly from the dynamics
	of the signaling patches.},

	employs the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system and more than 250 translocated

	trafficking pathways. Some of the effector proteins anchor through
	distinct PIs to the cytosolic face of LCVs and promote the interaction
	with host vesicles and organelles, catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange
	of small GTPases, or bind to PI-metabolizing enzymes, such as OCRL1.
	The PI 5-phosphatase OCRL1 and its Dictyostelium homologue Dd5P4
	restrict intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. Moreover, OCRL1/Dd5P4,

	Taken together, bacterial PI-binding effectors as well as host PIs

	characterise DSB repair in the amoeba Dictyostelium. HR is the principal
	pathway responsible for resistance to DSBs during vegetative cell
	growth, a stage of the life cycle when cells are predominantly in
	G2. However, we illustrate that restriction-enzyme-mediated integration

	We illustrate that Dclre1, a protein with similarity to the vertebrate
	NHEJ factor Artemis, is required for NHEJ independently of DNA termini
	complexity. Although vegetative dclre1(-) cells are not radiosensitive,
	they exhibit delayed DSB repair, further supporting a role for NHEJ
	during this stage of the life cycle. By contrast, cells lacking the
	Ku80 component of the Ku heterodimer that binds DNA ends to facilitate
	NHEJ exhibit no such defect and deletion of ku80 suppresses the DSB
	repair defect of dclre1(-) cells through increasing HR efficiency.
	These data illustrate a functional NHEJ pathway in vegetative Dictyostelium
	and the importance of Ku in regulating DSB repair choice during this

	protein kinase A (PKA) in many eukaryotes. PKA plays a critical role
	in Dictyostelium development but no CREB homologue has been identified

	bzpF(-) mutants produce compromised spores, which are extremely unstable

	(PBM) and showed that the motif with the highest specificity is a
	CRE-like sequence. BzpF is necessary to activate the transcription
	of at least 15 PKA-regulated, late-developmental target genes whose
	promoters contain BzpF binding motifs. BzpF is sufficient to activate
	two of these genes. The comparison of RNA sequencing data between

	research has identified a specific motility-enhancing function for
	epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) repeats in Dictyostelium, specifically
	for the EGFL repeats of cyrA, a matricellular, calmodulin (CaM)-binding
	protein in Dictyostelium. Using mutants of cAMP signaling (carA(-),
	carC(-), gpaB(-), gpbA(-)), the endogenous calcium (Ca(2+)) release
	inhibitor TMB-8, the CaM antagonist W-7, and a radial motility bioassay,
	we show that DdEGFL1, a synthetic peptide whose sequence is obtained
	from the first EGFL repeat of cyrA, functions independently of the
	cAMP-mediated signaling pathways to enhance cell motility through
	a mechanism involving Ca(2+) signaling, CaM, and RasG. We show that
	DdEGFL1 increases the amounts of polymeric myosin II heavy chain
	and actin in the cytoskeleton by 24.1+/-10.7% and 25.9+/-2.1% respectively
	and demonstrate a link between Ca(2+)/CaM signaling and cytoskeletal
	dynamics. Finally, our findings suggest that carA and carC mediate
	a brake mechanism during chemotaxis since DdEGFL1 enhanced the movement
	of carA(-)/carC(-) cells by 844+/-136% compared to only 106+/-6%
	for parental DH1 cells. Based on our data, this signaling pathway

	a GFP-based strain sensor termed PriSSM (PRIM-based strain sensor
	module), by using the proximity imaging (PRIM) technique, which detects
	spectral changes of two GFP molecules that are in direct contact.
	Using PriSSM-myosin II fusion proteins, the interaction between myosin
	II and F-actin can be detected in Dictyostelium cells. In the spectroscopic
	measurements of PriSSM, to decompose the measured spectra of the
	cells expressing the sensor proteins into the contributions from
	the sensor and the background autofluorescence, we applied the linear
	spectral unmixing approach, which was based on the assumption that
	the errors at each wavelength were independent. Cellular autofluorescence,
	however, often includes systematic errors, so that the unmixing procedures
	might lead to biased estimates. Here, to validate our spectral unmixing
	procedures, we estimate the possible maximum errors in the fluorescence
	ratio values that are obtained by unmixing spectra including such
	systematic errors. This estimation provided a general criterion to
	validate the results obtained by linear unmixing of spectra including
	serially correlated error terms. Using the proposed criterion and
	PriSSM-myosin II fusion proteins, we examined the interaction between
	myosin II and F-actin in Dictyostelium cells under several different
	conditions. The spectroscopic results, together with the microscopic
	observations of the cells expressing the proteins, suggest that the

	slight effect on binding to F-actin but has significant effects on

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Multicellularity in cellular slime molds is
	achieved by aggregation of several hundreds to thousands of cells.
	In the model slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, adenosine is known
	to increase the aggregate size and its antagonist caffeine reduces
	the aggregate size. However, it is not clear if the actions of adenosine
	and caffeine are evolutionarily conserved among other slime molds
	known to use structurally unrelated chemoattractants. We have examined
	how the known factors affecting aggregate size are modulated by adenosine
	and caffeine. Result: Adenosine and caffeine induced the formation
	of large and small aggregates respectively, in evolutionarily distinct
	slime molds known to use diverse chemoattractants for their aggregation.
	Due to its genetic tractability, we chose D. discoideum to further
	investigate the factors affecting aggregate size. The changes in
	aggregate size are caused by the effect of the compounds on several
	parameters such as cell number and size, cell-cell adhesion, cAMP
	signal relay and cell counting mechanisms. While some of the effects
	of these two compounds are opposite to each other, interestingly,
	both compounds increase the intracellular glucose level and strengthen
	cell-cell adhesion. These compounds also inhibit the synthesis of
	cAMP phosphodiesterase (PdsA), weakening the relay of extracellular
	cAMP signal. Adenosine as well as caffeine rescue mutants impaired
	in stream formation (pde4- and pdiA-) and colony size (smlA- and
	ctnA-) and restore their parental aggregate size. CONCLUSION: Adenosine
	increased the cell division timings thereby making large number of
	cells available for aggregation and also it marginally increased
	the cell size contributing to large aggregate size. Reduced cell
	division rates and decreased cell size in the presence of caffeine
	makes the aggregates smaller than controls. Both the compounds altered
	the speed of the chemotactic amoebae causing a variation in aggregate
	size. Our data strongly suggests that cytosolic glucose and extracellular
	cAMP levels are the other major determinants regulating aggregate
	size and pattern. Importantly, the aggregation process is conserved
	among different lineages of cellular slime molds despite using unrelated
	signalling molecules for aggregation.},

	we examined the effect of DIF-1 on human colon cancer cell lines

	that the binding site for the transcription factor early growth response-1
	(Egr-1), which is located in the -609 to -601 bp region relative

	regulations in living cells that can help to predict the system behavior

	to the development of improved diagnostic tests and therapeutics.
	DNA microarrays, which measure the expression level of thousands
	of genes in parallel, constitute the numeric seed for the inference
	of gene regulatory networks. In this paper, we have proposed a new
	approach for inferring gene regulatory networks from time-series
	gene expression data using linear time-variant model. Here, Self-Adaptive
	Differential Evolution, a versatile and robust Evolutionary Algorithm,
	is used as the learning paradigm. RESULTS: To assess the potency
	of the proposed work, a well known nonlinear synthetic network has
	been used. The reconstruction method has inferred this synthetic
	network topology and the associated regulatory parameters with high
	accuracy from both the noise-free and noisy time-series data. For
	validation purposes, the proposed approach is also applied to the
	simulated expression dataset of cAMP oscillations in Dictyostelium
	discoideum and has proved it's strength in finding the correct regulations.
	The strength of this work has also been verified by analyzing the
	real expression dataset of SOS DNA repair system in Escherichia coli
	and it has succeeded in finding more correct and reasonable regulations
	as compared to various existing works. CONCLUSION: By the proposed
	approach, the gene interaction networks have been inferred in an
	efficient manner from both the synthetic, simulated cAMP oscillation
	expression data and real expression data. The computational time
	of this approach is also considerably smaller, which makes it to
	be more suitable for larger network reconstruction. Thus the proposed
	approach can serve as an initiate for the future researches regarding

	amoebae aggregate together to form a multicellular fruiting body
	with dead stalk cells and live spores. Individuals can either cooperate
	with amoebae from the same clone, or sort to form clonal fruiting
	bodies. In this study we look at genetic diversity in P. violaceum
	and at how this diversity impacts social behavior. RESULTS: The phylogeny
	of the ribosomal DNA sequence (17S to 5.8S region) shows that P.
	violaceum is made up of at least two groups. Mating compatibility
	is more common between clones from the same phylogenetic group, though
	matings between clones from different phylogenetic groups sometimes
	occurred. P. violaceum clones are more likely to form clonal fruiting
	bodies when they are mixed with clones from a different group than
	when they are mixed with a clone of the same group. CONCLUSION: Both
	the phylogenetic and mating analyses suggest the possibility of cryptic
	species in P. violaceum. The level of divergence found within P.
	violaceum is comparable to the divergence between sibling species
	in other dictyostelids. Both major groups A/B and C/D/E/F show kin
	discrimination, which elevates relatedness within fruiting bodies
	but not to the level of clonality. The diminished cooperation in

	are rich in oscillatory regulation. When organized in space and time,
	periodic cell-cell signaling can give rise to long-range coordination
	of gene expression and cell movement in tissues. Lack of synchrony
	of the oscillations on the other hand can serve as a source of initial

	level remains elusive in most cases. Recently, studies in chemical

	of how excitable and oscillatory regulations could be tuned and coupled
	to give rise to tissue-level oscillations is emerging. The review
	focuses on recent progress in cyclic adenosine monophosphate oscillations
	in Dictyostelium and highlights similarities and differences with

	from the centrosome and forms a cloud-like structure around the spindle,
	which is totally absent during later stages until completion of mitosis.
	Our results suggest that a signal which originates from the NdrA

	As a result of microtubule stabilization, one of the first downstream

	1%. Risk of bipolar disorder is heavily influenced by genetic predisposition,
	but is a complex genetic trait and, to date, genetic studies have
	provided little insight into its molecular origins. An alternative
	approach is to investigate the genetics of Li(+) sensitivity. Using
	the social amoeba Dictyostelium, we previously identified prolyl
	oligopeptidase (PO) as a modulator of Li(+) sensitivity. In a link
	to the clinic, PO enzyme activity is altered in bipolar disorder
	patients. Further studies demonstrated that PO is a negative regulator

	intracellular signal. However, it was unclear how PO could influence
	either Li(+) sensitivity or risk of bipolar disorder. Here we show
	that in both Dictyostelium and cultured human cells PO acts via Multiple
	Inositol Polyphosphate Phosphatase (Mipp1) to control gene expression.
	This reveals a novel, gene regulatory network that modulates inositol
	metabolism and Li(+) sensitivity. Among its targets is the inositol
	monophosphatase gene IMPA2, which has also been associated with risk
	of bipolar disorder in some family studies, and our observations
	offer a cellular signalling pathway in which PO activity and IMPA2

	of MiDASes, mitosis-specific actin-rich adhesions. Loss of SCAR in

	activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator
	of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway by an unknown mechanism. They
	are also known to cause changes in the organization of the actin
	cytoskeleton. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that cucurbitacin
	I potently inhibits the migration of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)
	cell sheets during wound closure, as well as the random motility
	of B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells, but has no effect on movement of
	Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae. Upon treatment of MDCK or B16-F1
	cells with cucurbitacin I, there is a very rapid cessation of motility
	and gradual accumulation of filamentous actin aggregates. The cellular
	effect of the compound is similar to that observed when cells are
	treated with the actin filament-stabilizing agent jasplakinolide.
	However, we found that, unlike jasplakinolide or phallacidin, cucurbitacin
	I does not directly stabilize actin filaments. In in vitro actin
	depolymerization experiments, cucurbitacin I had no effect on the
	rate of actin filament disassembly at the nanomolar concentrations
	that inhibit cell migration. At elevated concentrations, the depolymerization
	rate was also unaffected, although there was a delay in the initiation
	of depolymerization. Therefore, cucurbitacin I targets some factor
	involved in cellular actin dynamics other than actin itself. Two
	candidate proteins that play roles in actin depolymerization are
	the actin-severing proteins cofilin and gelsolin. Cucurbitacin I
	possesses electrophilic reactivity that may lead to chemical modification

	have shown previously that cGMP binding to GbpC induces an intramolecular
	signaling cascade by activating subsequently the GEF, Ras, and kinase
	domains. In this study, we report on the cellular localization of
	GbpC. In resting cells, the protein is present in the cytoplasm,
	but GbpC rapidly translocates to the cell boundary upon stimulation
	with the chemoattractant cAMP. Also, during the formation of cell-cell
	streams and osmotic shock, the protein localizes toward the plasma
	membrane and actin cytoskeleton. The translocation upon cAMP stimulation
	occurs downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins but is independent
	of guanylyl cyclases and the previously identified cGMP-induced intramolecular
	signaling cascade in GbpC. Mutations in the GRAM domain of GbpC lead
	to disturbed membrane association and inactivation of GbpC function
	during chemotaxis in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the GRAM domain
	itself associates with cellular membranes and binds various phospholipids
	in vitro. Together, the results show that GbpC receives multiple
	input signals that are both required for functional activity in vivo.
	cAMP-stimulation induces a cGMP-dependent signaling cascade, leading
	to activation of kinase activity, and, independently, cAMP induces
	a GRAM-dependent translocation of GbpC toward the plasma membrane
	and cell cortex, where it may locally phosphorylate effector proteins,

	This work addresses the mechanism of SadA function, demonstrating

	We found that a SadA tailless mutant was unable to rescue the sadA

	Thus, our data demonstrate an important role for the carboxy-terminal

  abstract = {The Dictyostelium centrosome consists of a layered core structure
	surrounded by a microtubule-nucleating corona. A tight linkage through
	the nuclear envelope connects the cytosolic centrosome with the clustered
	centromeres within the nuclear matrix. At G2/M the corona dissociates,
	and the core structure duplicates, yielding two spindle poles. CP148
	is a novel coiled coil protein of the centrosomal corona. GFP-CP148
	exhibited cell cycle-dependent presence and absence at the centrosome,
	which correlates with dissociation of the corona in prophase and
	its reformation in late telophase. During telophase, GFP-CP148 formed
	cytosolic foci, which coalesced and joined the centrosome. This explains
	the hypertrophic appearance of the corona upon strong overexpression
	of GFP-CP148. Depletion of CP148 by RNAi caused virtual loss of the
	corona and disorganization of interphase microtubules. Surprisingly,
	formation of the mitotic spindle and astral microtubules was unaffected.
	Thus, microtubule nucleation complexes associate with centrosomal
	core components through different means during interphase and mitosis.
	Furthermore, CP148 RNAi caused dispersal of centromeres and altered
	Sun1 distribution at the nuclear envelope, suggesting a role of CP148
	in the linkage between centrosomes and centromeres. Taken together,
	CP148 is an essential factor for the formation of the centrosomal
	corona, which in turn is required for centrosome/centromere linkage.},

	expansions and contractions across the eukaryotic tree of life. Here,
	we assess diversity of actin gene sequences within three lineages
	of the genus Arcella, a free-living testate (shelled) amoeba in the
	Arcellinida. We established four clonal lines of two morphospecies,
	Arcella hemisphaerica and A. vulgaris, and assessed their phylogenetic
	relationship within the "Amoebozoa" using small subunit ribosomal
	DNA (SSU-rDNA) genealogy. We determined that the two lines of A.
	hemisphaerica are identical in SSU-rDNA, while the two A. vulgaris
	are independent genetic lineages. Furthermore, we characterized multiple
	actin gene copies from all lineages. Analyses of the resulting sequences
	reveal numerous diverse actin genes, which differ mostly by synonymous
	substitutions. We estimate that the actin gene family contains 40-50
	paralogous members in each lineage. None of the three independent
	lineages share the same paralog with another, and divergence between
	actins reaches 29% in contrast to just 2% in SSU-rDNA. Analyses of
	effective number of codons (ENC), compositional bias, recombination
	signatures, and genetic diversity in the context of a gene tree indicate
	that there are two groups of actins evolving with distinct patterns
	of molecular evolution. Within these groups, there have been multiple
	independent expansions of actin genes within each lineage. Together,
	these data suggest that the two groups are located in different regions
	of the Arcella genome. Furthermore, we compare the Arcella actin
	gene family with the relatively well-described gene family in the
	slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum and other members of the Amoebozoa
	clade. Overall patterns of molecular evolution are similar in Arcella
	and Dictyostelium. However, the separation of genes in two distinct
	groups coupled with recent expansion is characteristic of Arcella
	and might reflect an unusual pattern of gene family evolution in
	the lobose testate amoebae. We provide a model to account for both
	the existence of two distinct groups and the pattern of recent independent

  abstract = {Protein kinases AKT and PKBR1 of Dictyostelium belong to the AGC protein
	kinase superfamily. AKT and PKBR1 are phosphorylated at similar sites
	by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and TORC2 kinases;
	however, they have different subcellular localizing domains. AKT
	has a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
	[PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)]-regulated PH (pleckstrin homology) domain whereas
	PKBR1 is myristoylated and persistently membrane localized. Using
	strains defective for PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)-, PDK1- and TORC2-signaling
	or strains that express phospho-site mutants of AKT and PKBR1, we
	dissect the different roles of PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), PDK1 and TORC2.
	We show that activation of AKT and PKBR1 requires PDK1-site phosphorylation,
	but that phosphorylation by TORC2 is insufficient for AKT or PKBR1
	activation. However, PDK1-site phosphorylation is dependent on phosphorylation
	by TORC2, which suggests that there is regulatory coordination among
	PDK1, TORC2 and their phospho-site targets. This defines a separate
	input for signaling in control of chemotaxis and dependency on PDK1
	function. We also demonstrate that PDK1 in Dictyostelium functions
	independently of PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3). Finally, we show that AKT
	and PKBR1 exhibit substrate selectivity and identify two novel lipid-interacting
	proteins preferentially phosphorylated by AKT. Despite certain similarities,
	AKT and PKBR1 have distinct regulatory paths that impact activation
	and effector targeting, with PDK1 serving a central role.},

	the Chlamydiaceae, composed of several pathogens, such as Chlamydia
	trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci and Chlamydia
	abortus. Recently, 6 new families of Chlamydia-related bacteria have
	been added to the Chlamydiales order. Most of these obligate intracellular
	bacteria are able to replicate in free-living amoebae. Amoebal co-culture
	may be used to selectively isolate amoeba-resisting bacteria. This
	method allowed in a previous work to discover strain CRIB 30, from
	an environmental water sample. Based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence
	similarity with Criblamydia sequanensis, strain CRIB 30 was considered
	as a new member of the Criblamydiaceae family. In the present work,
	phylogenetic analyses of the genes gyrA, gyrB, rpoA, rpoB, secY,
	topA and 23S rRNA as well as MALDI-TOF MS confirmed the taxonomic
	classification of strain CRIB 30. Morphological examination revealed
	peculiar star-shaped elementary bodies (EBs) similar to those of
	C. sequanensis. Therefore, this new strain was called "Estrella lausannensis".
	Finally, E. lausannensis showed a large amoebal host range and a
	very efficient replication rate in Acanthamoeba species. Furthermore,
	E. lausannensis is the first member of the Chlamydiales order to
	grow successfully in the genetically tractable Dictyostelium discoideum,

	and, if it can be replaced by Phe, why has this happened so infrequently?
	We compared the properties of purified endogenous Dictyostelium actin
	and mutant constructs with Tyr-53 replaced by Phe, Ala, Glu, Trp,
	and Leu. The Y53F mutant did not differ significantly from endogenous
	actin in any of the properties assayed, but the Y53A and Y53E mutants
	differed substantially; affinity for DNase I was reduced, the rate
	of nucleotide exchange was increased, the critical concentration
	for polymerization was increased, filament elongation was inhibited,
	and polymerized actin was in the form of small oligomers and imperfect
	filaments. Growth and/or development of cells expressing these actin
	mutants were also inhibited. The Trp and Leu mutations had lesser

	properties of the purified actins. We conclude that either Tyr or
	Phe is required to maintain the functional conformations of the DNase
	I-binding loop (D-loop) in both G- and F-actin, and that the conformation
	of the D-loop affects not only the properties that directly involve
	the D-loop (binding to DNase I and polymerization) but also allosterically
	modifies the conformation of the nucleotide-binding cleft, thus increasing
	the rate of nucleotide exchange. The apparent evolutionary "preference"

	long and the disordered selected patterns in these proteomes has
	been performed. The matrices of correlation coefficients between
	numbers of proteins where at least once a homorepeat of six residues
	long for each of 20 types of amino acid residues and 109 disordered
	patterns from the library appears in 9 kingdoms of eukaryota and
	5 phyla of bacteria have been calculated. As a rule, the correlation
	coefficients are higher inside the considered kingdom than between
	them. The largest fraction of homorepeats of 6 residues belongs to
	Amoebozoa proteomes (D. discoideum), 46%. Moreover, the longest uninterrupted
	repeats belong to S306 from D. discoideum (Amoebozoa). Homorepeats
	of some amino acids occur more frequently than others and the type
	of homorepeats varies across different proteomes, . For example,

  abstract = {Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) functions both intracellularly as
	part of fatty acid metabolism and extracellularly as diazepam binding
	inhibitor, the precursor of endozepine peptides. Two of these peptides,
	ODN and TTN, bind to the GABA(A) receptor and modulate its sensitivity
	to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We have found that depolarization
	of mouse primary astrocytes induces the rapid release and processing
	of ACBP to the active peptides. We previously showed that ODN can
	trigger the rapid sporulation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium.
	Using this bioassay, we now show that astrocytes release the endozepine
	peptides within 10 min of exposure to the steroids cortisol, pregnenolone,
	pregnenolone sulfate, or progesterone. ACBP lacks a signal sequence
	for secretion through the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway and
	its secretion is not affected by addition of brefeldin A, a well
	known inhibitor of the classical secretion pathway, suggesting that
	it follows an unconventional pathway for secretion. Moreover, induction
	of autophagy by addition of rapamycin also resulted in rapid release
	of ACBP indicating that this protein uses components of the autophagy
	pathway for secretion. Following secretion, ACBP is proteolytically
	cleaved to the active neuropeptides by protease activity on the surface
	of astrocytes. Neurosteroids, such as pregnenolone sulfate, were
	previously shown to modulate the excitatory/inhibitory balance in
	brain through increased release of glutamate and decreased release
	of GABA. These effects of steroids in neurons will be reinforced
	by the release of endozepines from astrocytes shown here, and suggest
	an orchestrated astrocyte-neuron cross-talk that can affect a broad
	spectrum of behavioral functions.},

	machinery, but also because induction of ACD requires two successive
	exogenous signals, first the combination of starvation and cAMP,
	second the differentiation factor DIF-1. This enables one to analyze
	separately first-signal-induced autophagy and subsequent second-signal-induced
	ACD. We used mutants of atg1, a gene that plays an essential role
	in the initiation of autophagy. Upon starvation/cAMP, in contrast
	to parental cells, atg1 mutant cells showed irreversible lesions,
	clearly establishing a protective role for Atg1. Upon subsequent
	exposure to DIF-1 or to more ACD-specific second signals, starved
	parental cells progressed to ACD, but starved atg1 mutant cells did
	not, showing that Atg1 was required for ACD. Thus, in the same cells
	Atg1 was required in two apparently opposite ways, upon first-signaling
	for cell survival and upon second-signaling for ACD. Our findings
	strongly suggest that Atg1, thus presumably autophagy, protects the
	cells from starvation-induced cell death, allowing subsequent induction
	of ACD by the second signal. ACD is therefore not only "with" autophagy
	(since it showed signs of autophagy throughout), but is also "allowed
	by" autophagy. This does not exclude a role for autophagy also after
	second signaling. These results may account for discrepancies reported
	in the literature, encourage searches for second signals in different
	developmental models of ACD, and incite caution in autophagy-related

	Two recent papers highlighted in this punctum have elucidated the

	arrest and induction of developmental processes that occur upon starvation
	of Dictyostelium cells. yakA- cells are aggregation deficient, have
	a faster cell cycle and are hypersensitive to oxidative and nitrosoative
	stress. With the aim of isolating members of the YakA pathway, suppressors
	of the death induced by nitrosoative stress in the yakA- cells were
	identified. One of the suppressor mutations occurred in keaA, a gene
	identical to DG1106 and similar to Keap1 from mice and the Kelch
	protein from Drosophila, among others that contain Kelch domains.
	RESULTS: A mutation in keaA suppresses the hypersensitivity to oxidative
	and nitrosoative stresses but not the faster growth phenotype of
	yakA- cells. The growth profile of keaA deficient cells indicates
	that this gene is necessary for growth. keaA deficient cells are
	more resistant to nitrosoative and oxidative stress and keaA is necessary
	for the production and detection of cAMP. A morphological analysis
	of keaA deficient cells during multicellular development indicated
	that, although the mutant is not absolutely deficient in aggregation,
	cells do not efficiently participate in the process. Gene expression
	analysis using cDNA microarrays of wild-type and keaA deficient cells
	indicated a role for KeaA in the regulation of the cell cycle and
	pre-starvation responses. CONCLUSIONS: KeaA is required for cAMP
	signaling following stress. Our studies indicate a role for kelch
	proteins in the signaling that regulates the cell cycle and development
	in response to changes in the environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Dynein interacts with microtubules through a dedicated binding domain
	that is dynamically controlled to achieve high or low affinity, depending
	on the state of nucleotide bound in a distant catalytic pocket. The
	active sites for microtubule binding and ATP hydrolysis communicate
	via conformational changes transduced through a approximately 10-nm
	length antiparallel coiled-coil stalk, which connects the binding
	domain to the roughly 300-kDa motor core. Recently, an x-ray structure
	of the murine cytoplasmic dynein microtubule binding domain (MTBD)
	in a weak affinity conformation was published, containing a covalently
	constrained beta(+) registry for the coiled-coil stalk segment (Carter,
	A. P., Garbarino, J. E., Wilson-Kubalek, E. M., Shipley, W. E., Cho,
	C., Milligan, R. A., Vale, R. D., and Gibbons, I. R. (2008) Science

	MTBD from Dictyostelium discoideum that demonstrates the coiled-coil
	beta(+) registry corresponds to the low energy conformation for this
	functional region of dynein. Addition of sequence encoding roughly
	half of the coiled-coil stalk proximal to the binding tip results
	in a decreased affinity of the MTBD for microtubules. In contrast,
	addition of the complete coiled-coil sequence drives the MTBD to
	the conformationally unstable, high affinity binding state. These
	results suggest a thermodynamic coupling between conformational free
	energy differences in the alpha and beta(+) registries of the coiled-coil
	stalk that acts as a switch between high and low affinity conformations
	of the MTBD. A balancing of opposing conformations in the stalk and
	MTBD enables potentially modest long-range interactions arising from
	ATP binding in the motor core to induce a relaxation of the MTBD
	into the stable low affinity state.},

  abstract = {DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are complex lesions that covalently
	link both strands of the DNA double helix and impede essential cellular
	processes such as DNA replication and transcription. Recent studies
	suggest that multiple repair pathways are involved in their removal.
	Elegant genetic analysis has demonstrated that at least three distinct
	sets of pathways cooperate in the repair and/or bypass of ICLs in
	budding yeast. Although the mechanisms of ICL repair in mammals appear
	similar to those in yeast, important differences have been documented.
	In addition, mammalian crosslink repair requires other repair factors,
	such as the Fanconi anemia proteins, whose functions are poorly understood.
	Because many of these proteins are conserved in simpler metazoans,
	nonmammalian models have become attractive systems for studying the
	function(s) of key crosslink repair factors. This review discusses
	the contributions that various model organisms have made to the field
	of ICL repair. Specifically, it highlights how studies performed
	with C. elegans, Drosophila, Xenopus, and the social amoeba Dictyostelium
	serve to complement those from bacteria, yeast, and mammals. Together,
	these investigations have revealed that although the underlying themes
	of ICL repair are largely conserved, the complement of DNA repair
	proteins utilized and the ways in which each of the proteins is used
	can vary substantially between different organisms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microorganisms are ubiquitous, yet we are only beginning
	to understand their diversity and population structure. Social amoebae
	(Dictyostelia) are a diverse group of unicellular eukaryotic microbes
	that display a unique social behaviour upon starvation in which cells
	congregate and then some die to help others survive and disperse.
	The genetic relationships among co-occurring cells have a major influence
	on the evolution of social traits and recent population genetic analysis
	found extensive genetic variation and possible cryptic speciation
	in one dictyostelid species (Dictyostelium purpureum). To further
	characterize the interplay among genetic variation, species boundaries,
	social behaviour, and reproductive isolation in the Dictyostelia,
	we conducted phylogenetic analyses and mating experiments with the
	geographically widespread social amoeba Dictyostelium giganteum.
	RESULTS: We sequenced approximately 4,000 basepairs of the nuclear
	ribosomal DNA from 24 isolates collected from Texas, Michigan, Massachusetts,
	Virginia, and Wisconsin and identified 16 unique haplotypes. Analyses
	of the sequence data revealed very little genetic differentiation
	among isolates and no clear evidence of phylogenetic structure, although
	there was evidence for some genetic differentiation between the Massachusetts
	and Texas populations. These results suggest that sexual mating (macrocyst
	formation) is not likely to correlate with either genetic or geographical
	distance. To test this prediction, we performed 108 mating experiments
	and found no association between mating probability and genetic or
	geographical distance. CONCLUSIONS: D. giganteum isolates from across
	North America display little genetic variation, phylogeographic structure,
	and genetic differentiation among populations relative to the cryptic
	species observed within D. purpureum. Furthermore, variation that
	does exist does not predict the probability of mating among clones.
	These results have important implications for our understanding of
	speciation and social evolution in microbes.},

	amoebae respond to gradient switching rates below 0.02 Hz by readapting

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The success of molecular systems biology hinges on the
	ability to use computational models to design predictive experiments,
	and ultimately unravel underlying biological mechanisms. A problem
	commonly encountered in the computational modelling of biological
	networks is that alternative, structurally different models of similar
	complexity fit a set of experimental data equally well. In this case,
	more than one molecular mechanism can explain available data. In
	order to rule out the incorrect mechanisms, one needs to invalidate
	incorrect models. At this point, new experiments maximizing the difference
	between the measured values of alternative models should be proposed
	and conducted. Such experiments should be optimally designed to produce
	data that are most likely to invalidate incorrect model structures.
	RESULTS: In this paper we develop methodologies for the optimal design
	of experiments with the aim of discriminating between different mathematical
	models of the same biological system. The first approach determines
	the 'best' initial condition that maximizes the L2 (energy) distance
	between the outputs of the rival models. In the second approach,
	we maximize the L2-distance of the outputs by designing the optimal
	external stimulus (input) profile of unit L2-norm. Our third method
	uses optimized structural changes (corresponding, for example, to
	parameter value changes reflecting gene knock-outs) to achieve the
	same goal. The numerical implementation of each method is considered
	in an example, signal processing in starving Dictyostelium amoebae.
	CONCLUSIONS: Model-based design of experiments improves both the
	reliability and the efficiency of biochemical network model discrimination.
	This opens the way to model invalidation, which can be used to perfect
	our understanding of biochemical networks. Our general problem formulation
	together with the three proposed experiment design methods give the
	practitioner new tools for a systems biology approach to experiment
	design.},

	levels of cAMP formed by P. putida cells were below detection with

	was poorly translated or rendered non-functional in the heterologous

	virulence mechanism in several Gram-negative pathogens. In Vibrio
	cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, a
	minimum of three gene clusters--one main cluster and two auxiliary
	clusters--are required to form a functional T6SS apparatus capable
	of conferring virulence toward eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts.
	Despite an increasing understanding of the components that make up
	the T6SS apparatus, little is known about the regulation of these
	genes and the gene products delivered by this nanomachine. VasH is
	an important regulator of the V. cholerae T6SS. Here, we present
	evidence that VasH regulates the production of a newly identified
	protein, VasX, which in turn requires a functional T6SS for secretion.
	Deletion of vasX does not affect export or enzymatic function of
	the structural T6SS proteins Hcp and VgrG-1, suggesting that VasX
	is dispensable for the assembly of the physical translocon complex.
	VasX localizes to the bacterial membrane and interacts with membrane
	lipids. We present VasX as a novel virulence factor of the T6SS,
	as a V. cholerae mutant lacking vasX exhibits a phenotype of attenuated
	virulence toward Dictyostelium discoideum.},

	a gain-of-function mechanism that leads to selective neuronal loss
	in Huntington's disease (HD). Genetic evidence in humans and knock-in
	mouse models suggests that this gain-of-function involves an increase
	or deregulation of some aspect of huntingtin's normal function(s),
	which remains poorly understood. As huntingtin shows evolutionary
	conservation, a powerful approach to discovering its normal biochemical
	role(s) is to study the effects caused by its deficiency in a model
	organism with a short life-cycle that comprises both cellular and
	multicellular developmental stages. To facilitate studies aimed at
	detailed knowledge of huntingtin's normal function(s), we generated
	a null mutant of hd, the HD ortholog in Dictyostelium discoideum.
	Dictyostelium cells lacking endogenous huntingtin were viable but
	during development did not exhibit the typical polarized morphology
	of Dictyostelium cells, streamed poorly to form aggregates by accretion
	rather than chemotaxis, showed disorganized F-actin staining, exhibited
	extreme sensitivity to hypoosmotic stress, and failed to form EDTA-resistant
	cell-cell contacts. Surprisingly, chemotactic streaming could be
	rescued in the presence of the bivalent cations Ca(2+) or Mg(2+)
	but not pulses of cAMP. Although hd(-) cells completed development,
	it was delayed and proceeded asynchronously, producing small fruiting
	bodies with round, defective spores that germinated spontaneously
	within a glassy sorus. When developed as chimeras with wild-type
	cells, hd(-) cells failed to populate the pre-spore region of the
	slug. In Dictyostelium, huntingtin deficiency is compatible with
	survival of the organism but renders cells sensitive to low osmolarity,
	which produces pleiotropic cell autonomous defects that affect cAMP
	signaling and as a consequence development. Thus, Dictyostelium provides
	a novel haploid organism model for genetic, cell biological, and

	Trypanosoma evansi. Selective inhibition of Hsp90 has also been explored
	as an intervention strategy against important human diseases such
	as cancer, malaria, or trypanosomiasis. Giardia lamblia, a simple
	protozoan parasite of humans and animals, is an important cause of
	diarrheal disease with significant morbidity and some mortality in
	tropical countries. Here we show that the G. lamblia cytosolic hsp90
	(glhsp90) is split in two similar sized fragments located 777 kb
	apart on the same scaffold. Intrigued by this unique arrangement,
	which appears to be specific for the Giardiinae, we have investigated
	the biosynthesis of GlHsp90. We used genome sequencing to confirm
	the split nature of the giardial hsp90. However, a specific antibody
	raised against the peptide detected a product with a mass of about
	80 kDa, suggesting a post-transcriptional rescue of the genomic defect.
	We show evidence for the joining of the two independent Hsp90 transcripts
	in-trans to one long mature mRNA presumably by RNA splicing. The
	splicing junction carries hallmarks of classical cis-spliced introns,
	suggesting that the regular cis-splicing machinery may be sufficient
	for repair of the open reading frame. A complementary 26-nt sequence
	in the "intron" regions adjacent to the splice sites may assist in
	positioning the two pre-mRNAs for processing. This is the first example
	of post-transcriptional rescue of a split gene by trans-splicing.},

	revealed a remarkable array of genes homologous to polyketide synthases
	(PKSs) that are known to synthesize secondary metabolites in bacteria
	and fungi. A crucial step in functional activation of PKSs involves
	their post-translational modification catalyzed by phosphopantetheinyl
	transferases (PPTases). PPTases have been recently characterized
	from several bacteria; however, their relevance in complex life cycle
	of protozoa remains largely unexplored. Here we have identified and
	characterized two phosphopantetheinyl transferases from D. discoideum
	that exhibit distinct functional specificity. DiAcpS specifically
	modifies a stand-alone acyl carrier protein (ACP) that possesses
	a mitochondrial import signal. DiSfp in contrast is specific to Type
	I multifunctional PKS/fatty acid synthase proteins and cannot modify
	the stand-alone ACP. The mRNA of two PPTases can be detected during
	the vegetative as well as starvation-induced developmental pathway
	and the disruption of either of these genes results in non-viable
	amoebae. Our studies show that both PPTases play an important role

	individuals. This makes it impossible to associate an invariant phenotype
	with a genotype: the social context is crucial. Descriptions of metazoan
	development, which often is viewed as the acme of cooperative social
	behaviour, ignore or downplay this fact. The implicit justification
	for doing so is based on a group-selectionist point of view. Namely,
	embryos are clones, therefore all cells have the same evolutionary
	interest, and the visible differences between cells result from a
	common strategy. The reasoning is flawed, because phenotypic heterogeneity
	within groups can result from contingent choices made by cells from
	a flexible repertoire as in multicellular development. What makes
	that possible is phenotypic plasticity, namely the ability of a genotype
	to exhibit different phenotypes. However, co-operative social behaviour
	with division of labour requires that different phenotypes interact
	appropriately, not that they belong to the same genotype, or have
	overlapping genetic interests. We sketch a possible route to the
	evolution of social groups that involves many steps: (a) individuals
	that happen to be in spatial proximity benefit simply by virtue of
	their number; (b) traits that are already present act as preadaptations
	and improve the efficiency of the group; and (c) new adaptations
	evolve under selection in the social context--that is, via interactions
	between individuals--and further strengthen group behaviour. The
	Dictyostelid or cellular slime mould amoebae (CSMs) become multicellular
	in an unusual way, by the aggregation of free-living cells. In nature
	the resulting group can be genetically homogeneous (clonal) or heterogeneous
	(polyclonal); in either case its development, which displays strong
	cooperation between cells (to the extent of so-called altruism) is
	not affected. This makes the CSMs exemplars for the study of social

  abstract = {The mechanism of eukaryotic chemotaxis remains unclear despite intensive
	study. The most frequently described mechanism acts through attractants
	causing actin polymerization, in turn leading to pseudopod formation
	and cell movement. We recently proposed an alternative mechanism,
	supported by several lines of data, in which pseudopods are made
	by a self-generated cycle. If chemoattractants are present, they
	modulate the cycle rather than directly causing actin polymerization.
	The aim of this work is to test the explanatory and predictive powers
	of such pseudopod-based models to predict the complex behaviour of
	cells in chemotaxis. We have now tested the effectiveness of this
	mechanism using a computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis
	based on pseudopod autocatalysis. The model reproduces a surprisingly
	wide range of existing data about cell movement and chemotaxis. It
	simulates cell polarization and persistence without stimuli and selection
	of accurate pseudopods when chemoattractant gradients are present.
	It predicts both bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant
	gradients and--unexpectedly--lateral pseudopod initiation in high
	gradients. To test the predictive ability of the model, we looked
	for untested and novel predictions. One prediction from the model
	is that the angle between successive pseudopods at the front of the
	cell will increase in proportion to the difference between the cell's
	direction and the direction of the gradient. We measured the angles
	between pseudopods in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells under different
	conditions and found the results agreed with the model extremely
	well. Our model and data together suggest that in rapidly moving
	cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils an intrinsic pseudopod cycle
	lies at the heart of cell motility. This implies that the mechanism
	behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behaviour,
	more than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by
	chemoattractants.},

	multicellular development leading to fruiting bodies, sexual multicellular
	development resulting in macrocysts, and unicellular development
	generating microcysts. This review covers the events of sexual development
	in the best-studied heterothallic (Dictyostelium discoideum) and
	homothallic (D. mucoroides) mating systems. Sexual development begins
	with pheromonal interactions that produce fusion-competent cells
	(gametes) which undergo cell and pronuclear fusion. Calcium- and
	calmodulin-mediated signalling mediates these early events. As they
	initiate chemotactic signalling, each zygote increases in size becoming
	a zygote giant cell. Using cyclic AMP (cAMP), the zygote chemotactically
	lures in amoebae and engulfs them in an act of cannibalistic phagocytosis.
	Chemotaxis proceeds more quickly than endocytosis because the breakdown
	products of cAMP (5-AMP, adenosine) bind to a presumptive adenosine
	receptor to inhibit sexual phagocytosis. This slowing of phagocytosis
	allows amoebae to accumulate around the zygote to form a precyst
	aggregate. Zygote giant cells also produce several other signalling
	molecules that feed back to regulate early events. The amoebae surrounding
	the zygote seal their fate as zygotic foodstuff by secreting a primary
	cellulose wall, the extracellular sheath, around the zygote and aggregated
	amoebae, which prevents their escape. Phagocytosis within this precyst
	continues until all peripheral amoebae are internalized as endocytes
	and the final macrocyst wall is formed. Endocyte digestion results
	in a mature macrocyst with a uniform cytoplasm containing a diploid
	nucleus. After detailing the morphological events of heterothallic
	and homothallic mating, we review the various intercellular signalling
	events and other mechanisms involved in each stage. This complete
	and comprehensive review sets the stage for future research on the
	unique events that characterize sex in the social amoebozoans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying candidate genes in genetic networks is important
	for understanding regulation and biological function. Large gene
	expression datasets contain relevant information about genetic networks,
	but mining the data is not a trivial task. Algorithms that infer
	Bayesian networks from expression data are powerful tools for learning
	complex genetic networks, since they can incorporate prior knowledge
	and uncover higher-order dependencies among genes. However, these
	algorithms are computationally demanding, so novel techniques that
	allow targeted exploration for discovering new members of known pathways
	are essential. RESULTS: Here we describe a Bayesian network approach
	that addresses a specific network within a large dataset to discover
	new components. Our algorithm draws individual genes from a large
	gene-expression repository, and ranks them as potential members of
	a known pathway. We apply this method to discover new components
	of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway, a central regulator
	of Dictyostelium discoideum development. The PKA network is well
	studied in D. discoideum but the transcriptional networks that regulate
	PKA activity and the transcriptional outcomes of PKA function are
	largely unknown. Most of the genes highly ranked by our method encode
	either known components of the PKA pathway or are good candidates.
	We tested 5 uncharacterized highly ranked genes by creating mutant

	anatomies despite vast differences between their genome sequences.
	The social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum
	have similar developmental morphologies although their genomes are
	as divergent as those of man and jawed fish. RESULTS: Here we show
	that the anatomical similarities are accompanied by extensive transcriptome
	conservation. Using RNA sequencing we compared the abundance and
	developmental regulation of all the transcripts in the two species.
	In both species, most genes are developmentally regulated and the
	greatest expression changes occur during the transition from unicellularity
	to multicellularity. The developmental regulation of transcription
	is highly conserved between orthologs in the two species. In addition
	to timing of expression, the level of mRNA production is also conserved
	between orthologs and is consistent with the intuitive notion that
	transcript abundance correlates with the amount of protein required.
	Furthermore, the conservation of transcriptomes extends to cell-type
	specific expression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that developmental
	programs are remarkably conserved at the transcriptome level, considering
	the great evolutionary distance between the genomes. Moreover, this
	transcriptional conservation may be responsible for the similar developmental
	anatomies of Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum.},

	should favor exploitative individuals that avoid paying their fair
	share of any costs. Such conflict between the self-interests of cooperating
	individuals often results in the evolution of complex, opponent-specific,
	social strategies and counterstrategies. However, the genetic and
	biological mechanisms underlying complex social strategies, and therefore
	the evolution of cooperative behavior, are largely unknown. To address
	this dearth of empirical data, we combine mathematical modeling,
	molecular genetic, and developmental approaches to test whether variation
	in the production of and response to social signals is sufficient
	to generate the complex partner-specific social success seen in the
	social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Firstly, we find that the
	simple model of production of and response to social signals can
	generate the sort of apparent complex changes in social behavior
	seen in this system, without the need for partner recognition. Secondly,
	measurements of signal production and response in a mutant with a
	change in a single gene that leads to a shift in social behavior
	provide support for this model. Finally, these simple measurements
	of social signaling can also explain complex patterns of variation
	in social behavior generated by the natural genetic diversity found
	in isolates collected from the wild. Our studies therefore demonstrate
	a novel and elegantly simple underlying mechanistic basis for natural
	variation in complex social strategies in D. discoideum. More generally,
	they suggest that simple rules governing interactions between individuals
	can be sufficient to generate a diverse array of outcomes that appear
	complex and unpredictable when those rules are unknown.},

	proliferation within both macrophages and protozoan hosts. We show
	that the F-box domain of AnkB and the (9)L(10)P conserved residues
	are essential for intracellular bacterial proliferation and for rapid
	acquisition of polyubiquitinated proteins by the Legionella-containing
	vacuole (LCV) within macrophages, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Acanthamoeba.
	Interestingly, translocation of AnkB and recruitment of polyubiquitinated
	proteins in macrophages and Acanthamoeba is rapidly triggered by
	extracellular bacteria within 5 min of bacterial attachment. Ectopically
	expressed AnkB within mammalian cells is localized to the periphery
	of the cell where it co-localizes with host SKP1 and recruits polyubiquitinated
	proteins, which results in restoration of intracellular growth to
	the ankB mutant similar to the parental strain. While an ectopically
	expressed AnkB-(9)L(10)P/AA variant is localized to the cell periphery,
	it does not recruit polyubiquitinated proteins and fails to trans-rescue
	the ankB mutant intracellular growth defect. Direct in vivo interaction
	of AnkB but not the AnkB-(9)L(10)P/AA variant with the host SKP1
	is demonstrated. Importantly, RNAi-mediated silencing of expression
	of SKP1 renders the cells non-permissive for intracellular proliferation
	of L. pneumophila. The role of AnkB in exploitation of the polyubiquitination
	machinery is essential for intrapulmonary bacterial proliferation
	in the mouse model of Legionnaires' disease. Therefore, AnkB exhibits
	a novel molecular and functional mimicry of eukaryotic F-box proteins
	that exploits conserved polyubiquitination machinery for intracellular
	proliferation within evolutionarily distant hosts.},

	by a large non-cytoplasmic domain and nine putative transmembrane
	domains. This family is highly conserved through evolution and comprises
	three members in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum,
	and Drosophila melanogaster, and four members are reported in mammals
	(TM9SF1-TM9SF4). Genetic studies in Dictyostelium and Drosophila
	have shown that TM9SF members are required for adhesion and phagocytosis
	in innate immune response, furthermore, human TM9SF1 plays a role
	in the regulation of autophagy and human TM9SF4 in tumor cannibalism.
	Here we report that the zebrafish genome encodes five members of
	this family, TM9SF1-TM9SF5, which show high level of sequence conservation
	with the previously reported members. Expression analysis in zebrafish
	showed that all members are maternally expressed and continue to
	be present throughout embryogenesis to adults. Gene expression could
	not be regulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as
	LPS, CpG, or Poly I:C. By bioinformatic analyses of 80 TM9SF protein
	sequences from yeast, plants, and animals, we confirmed a very conserved
	protein structure. An evolutionary conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
	inhibition motif has been detected in the cytoplasmic domain between
	transmembrane domain (TM) 7 and TM8 in TM9SF1, TM9SF2, TM9SF4 and
	TM9SF5, and at the extreme C-terminal end of TM9SF4. Finally, a conserved
	TRAF2 binding domain could also be predicted in the cytoplasmic regions
	of TM9SF2, TM9SF3, TM9SF4, and TM9SF5. This confirms the hypothesis
	that TM9SF proteins may play a regulatory role in a specific and

	cell death is well addressed, its role in development and multicellularity
	is still an enigma. We have previously reported the role of PARP
	in oxidative stress induced delayed development of D. discoideum.
	RESULTS: In the current study we highlight the involvement of PARP
	during D. discoideum development. Oxidative stress affects expression
	of aca and cAR1 thus affecting aggregation. Although parp expression
	is not affected during oxidative stress but it is involved during
	normal development as confirmed by our PARP down-regulation studies.
	Constitutive PARP down-regulation resulted in blocked development
	while no effect was observed on D. discoideum growth. Interestingly,
	stage specific PARP down-regulation arrested development at the slug
	stage. CONCLUSION: These results emphasize that PARP is essential
	for complex differentiation and its function may be linked to multicellularity.
	This is the first report where the involvement of PARP during normal
	multicellular development in D. discoideum, an ancient eukaryote,
	is established which could be of evolutionary significance. Thus
	our study adds one more role to the multitasking function of PARP.},

	The initial stages of development involve the aggregation of individual
	cells, using cAMP as a chemoattractant. Chemotaxis is initiated when
	cAMP binds to its receptor, cAR1, and activates the associated G
	protein, Galpha2betagamma. However, chemotaxis will not occur unless
	there is a high density of starving cells present, as measured by
	high levels of the secreted quorum sensing molecule, CMF. We previously
	demonstrated that cells lacking PldB bypass the need for CMF and
	can aggregate at low cell density, whereas cells overexpressing pldB
	do not aggregate even at high cell density. Here, we found that PldB
	controlled both cAMP chemotaxis and cell sorting. PldB was also required
	by CMF to regulate G protein signaling. Specifically, CMF used PldB,
	to regulate the dissociation of Galpha2 from Gbetagamma. Using fluorescence
	resonance energy transfer (FRET), we found that along with cAMP,
	CMF increased the dissociation of the G protein. In fact, CMF augmented
	the dissociation induced by cAMP. This augmentation was lost in cells
	lacking PldB. PldB appears to mediate the CMF signal through the

	to allow registered users to share and edit notes on the use of each
	term in GO, and to contribute annotations for specific genes of interest.
	By providing a site for generation of third-party documentation at
	the granularity of individual terms, GONUTS complements the official

	from seven model organisms: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium
	discoideum, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio
	rerio, Mus musculus and Arabidopsis thaliana. To support community
	annotation, GONUTS allows automated creation of gene pages for gene
	products in UniProt. GONUTS will improve the consistency of annotation
	efforts across genome projects, and should be useful in training
	new annotators and consumers in the production of GO annotations
	and the use of GO terms. GONUTS can be accessed at http://gowiki.tamu.edu.

	in a range of unpleasant experiments involving retching, vomiting

	We have used a range of compounds with known emetic /aversive properties
	to examine the possibility of using the social amoeba, Dictyostelium
	discoideum, for research into identifying and understanding emetic
	liability, and hence reduce adverse animal experimentation in this
	area. Twenty eight emetic or taste aversive compounds were employed
	to investigate the acute (10 min) effect of compounds on Dictyostelium
	cell behaviour (shape, speed and direction of movement) in a shallow
	chemotaxic gradient (Dunn chamber). Compound concentrations were
	chosen based on those previously reported to be emetic or aversive
	in in vivo studies and results were recorded and quantified by automated
	image analysis. Dictyostelium cell motility was rapidly and strongly
	inhibited by four structurally distinct tastants (three bitter tasting
	compounds--denatonium benzoate, quinine hydrochloride, phenylthiourea,
	and the pungent constituent of chilli peppers--capsaicin). In addition,
	stomach irritants (copper chloride and copper sulphate), and a phosphodiesterase
	IV inhibitor also rapidly blocked movement. A concentration-dependant
	relationship was established for five of these compounds, showing
	potency of inhibition as capsaicin (IC(50) = 11.9 +/- 4.0 microM)
	&gt; quinine hydrochloride (IC(50) = 44.3 +/- 6.8 microM) &gt; denatonium
	benzoate (IC(50) = 129 +/- 4 microM) &gt; phenylthiourea (IC(50)
	= 366 +/- 5 microM) &gt; copper sulphate (IC(50) = 1433 +/- 3 microM).
	In contrast, 21 compounds within the cytotoxic and receptor agonist/antagonist
	classes did not affect cell behaviour. Further analysis of bitter
	and pungent compounds showed that the effect on cell behaviour was
	reversible and not cytotoxic, suggesting an uncharacterised molecular
	mechanism of action for these compounds. These results therefore
	demonstrate that Dictyostelium has potential as a non-sentient model
	in the analysis of the molecular effects of tastants, although it
	has limited utility in identification of emetic agents in general.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social Amoebae or Dictyostelia are eukaryotic microbes
	with a unique life cycle consisting of both uni- and multicellular
	stages. They have long fascinated molecular, developmental and evolutionary
	biologists, and Dictyostelium discoideum is now one of the most widely
	studied eukaryotic microbial models. The first molecular phylogeny
	of Dictyostelia included most of the species known at the time and
	suggested an extremely deep taxon with a molecular depth roughly
	equivalent to Metazoa. The group was also shown to consist of four
	major clades, none of which correspond to traditional genera. Potential
	morphological justification was identified for three of the four
	major groups, on the basis of which tentative names were assigned.
	RESULTS: Over the past four years, the Mycetozoan Global Biodiversity
	Survey has identified many new isolates that appear to be new species
	of Dictyostelia, along with numerous isolates of previously described
	species. We have determined 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequences for
	all of these new isolates. Phylogenetic analyses of these data show
	at least 50 new species, and these arise from throughout the dictyostelid
	tree breaking up many previously isolated long branches. The resulting
	tree now shows eight well-supported major groups instead of the original
	four. The new species also expand the known morphological diversity
	of the previously established four major groups, violating nearly
	all previously suggested deep morphological patterns. CONCLUSIONS:
	A greatly expanded phylogeny of Dictyostelia now shows even greater
	morphological plasticity at deep taxonomic levels. In fact, there
	now seem to be no obvious deep evolutionary trends across the group.
	However at a finer level, patterns in morphological character evolution
	are beginning to emerge. These results also suggest that there is
	a far greater diversity of Dictyostelia yet to be discovered, including
	novel morphologies.},

	of microtubules (MTs) and associated proteins that are required during
	mitosis for the correct partitioning of the two sets of chromosomes
	to the daughter cells. In addition to the well-established functions
	of MT-associated proteins (MAPs) and MT-based motors in cell division,
	there is increasing evidence that the F-actin-based myosin motors
	are important mediators of F-actin-MT interactions during mitosis.
	Here, we report the functional characterization of the long-tailed
	class-1 myosin myosin-1C from Dictyostelium discoideum during mitosis.
	Our data reveal that myosin-1C binds to MTs and has a role in maintenance
	of spindle stability for accurate chromosome separation. Both myosin-1C
	motor function and tail-domain-mediated MT-F-actin interactions are
	required for the cell-cycle-dependent relocalization of the protein
	from the cell periphery to the spindle. We show that the association
	of myosin-1C with MTs is mediated through the tail domain. The myosin-1C
	tail can inhibit kinesin motor activity, increase the stability of
	MTs, and form crosslinks between MTs and F-actin. These data illustrate
	that myosin-1C is involved in the regulation of MT function during

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Altruism can be favored by high relatedness among interactants.
	We tested the effect of relatedness in experimental populations of
	the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, where altruism occurs
	in a starvation-induced social stage when some amoebae die to form
	a stalk that lifts the fertile spores above the soil facilitating
	dispersal. The single cells that aggregate during the social stage
	can be genetically diverse, which can lead to conflict over spore
	and stalk allocation. We mixed eight genetically distinct wild isolates
	and maintained twelve replicated populations at a high and a low
	relatedness treatment. After one and ten social generations we assessed
	the strain composition of the populations. We expected that some
	strains would be out-competed in both treatments. In addition, we
	expected that low relatedness might allow the persistence of social
	cheaters as it provides opportunity to exploit other strains. RESULTS:
	We found that at high relatedness a single clone prevailed in all
	twelve populations. At low relatedness three clones predominated
	in all twelve populations. Interestingly, exploitation of some clones
	by others in the social stage did not explain the results. When we
	mixed each winner against the pool of five losers, the winner did
	not prevail in the spores because all contributed fairly to the stalk
	and spores. Furthermore, the dominant clone at high-relatedness was
	not cheated by the other two that persisted at low relatedness. A
	combination of high spore production and short unicellular stage
	most successfully explained the three successful clones at low relatedness,
	but not why one of them fared better at high relatedness. Differences
	in density did not account for the results, as the clones did not
	differ in vegetative growth rates nor did they change the growth
	rates over relevant densities. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest
	that social competition and something beyond solitary growth differences
	occurs during the vegetative stage when amoebae eat bacteria and
	divide by binary fission. The high degree of repeatability of our
	results indicates that these effects are strong and points to the
	importance of new approaches to studying interactions in D. discoideum.},

	by the self-assembly of proteins within living cells. They are built
	from actin filaments together with single-headed myosin, the Arp23
	complex, and coronin in a defined three-dimensional order. The function
	of these waves in structuring the cell cortex is studied on the substrate-attached
	surface of Dictyostelium cells by the use of total internal reflection
	fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Actin waves separate two areas of
	the cell cortex from each other, which are distinguished by the arrangement
	of actin filaments. The Arp23 complex dominates in the area enclosed
	by a wave, where it has the capacity of building dendritic structures,
	while the proteins prevailing in the external area, cortexillin I
	and myosin-II, bundle actin filaments and arrange them in antiparallel
	direction. Wave propagation is accompanied by transitions in the
	state of actin with a preferential period of 5 min. Wave generation
	is preceded by local fluctuations in actin assembly, some of the
	nuclei of polymerized actin emanating from clathrin-coated structures,
	others emerging independently. The dynamics of phase transitions
	has been analyzed to provide a basis for modeling the nonlinear interactions
	that produce spatio-temporal patterns in the actin system of living

	Novel fluorescent methods have enabled the direct visualization of

	in living cells. However, it is difficult to observe internalization
	of GPCRs in vivo due to intrinsic autofluorescence and cytosolic

	positional accuracy of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to
	visualize in real time the internalization of Dictyostelium discoideum
	cAMP receptors, cAR1, genetically encoded with eYFP. This technique
	made it possible to follow the number of receptors in time revealing
	that the fraction of cytosolic receptors increases after persistent
	agonist stimulation and that the majority of the receptors were degraded
	after internalization. The observed internalization process was phosphorylation
	dependent, as shown with the use of a phosphorylation deficient cAR1
	mutant, cm1234-eYFP, or stimulation with an antagonist, Rp-cAMPS
	that does not induce receptor phosphorylation. Furthermore, experiments
	done in mound-stage cells suggest that intrinsic, phosphorylation-induced
	internalization of cAR1 is necessary for Dictyostelium wild type
	cells to progress properly through multicellular development. To
	our knowledge, this observation illustrates for the first time phosphorylation-dependent
	internalization of single cAR1 molecules in living cells and its

	in the cell death process, and thus contributes to the confusion
	in the literature regarding the role of autophagy in cell death and
	cell survival. Here we propose to define autophagic cell death as
	a modality of non-apoptotic or necrotic programmed cell death in
	which autophagy serves as a cell death mechanism, upon meeting the
	following set of criteria: (i) cell death occurs without the involvement
	of apoptosis; (ii) there is an increase of autophagic flux, and not
	just an increase of the autophagic markers, in the dying cells; and
	(iii) suppression of autophagy via both pharmacological inhibitors
	and genetic approaches is able to rescue or prevent cell death. In
	light of this new definition, we will discuss some of the common
	problems and difficulties in the study of autophagic cell death and
	also revisit some well-reported cases of autophagic cell death, aiming
	to achieve a better understanding of whether autophagy is a real
	killer, an accomplice or just an innocent bystander in the course
	of cell death. At present, the physiological relevance of autophagic
	cell death is mainly observed in lower eukaryotes and invertebrates
	such as Dictyostelium discoideum and Drosophila melanogaster. We

	help us study and understand the physiological or pathological relevance

	The third subfamily represented with three members in D. discoideum

	devices. The gradients are generated by molecular diffusion between
	two 80 mum deep flow-through channels, one of which is perfused with

	Chemotactic cells enter these low ceiling chambers by flattening

	found in diverse eukaryotic organisms. We are studying the function
	of copines in Dictyostelium discoideum, a single-celled amoeba that
	undergoes cell differentiation and morphogenesis to form multicellular
	fruiting bodies when placed in starvation conditions. Previously,
	we showed that Dictyostelium cells lacking the copine A (cpnA) gene
	are not able to complete the developmental cycle, arresting at the
	slug stage. The aim of this study is to further characterize the
	developmental defect of the cpnA- cells. RESULTS: Time-lapse imaging
	revealed that cpnA- cells exhibited delayed aggregation and made
	large mounds that formed one large slug as compared to the smaller
	slugs of the wild-type cells. While the prespore cell patterning
	appeared to be normal within the cpnA- slugs, the prestalk cell patterning
	was different from wild-type. When cpnA- cells were mixed with a
	small percentage of wild-type cells, chimeric fruiting bodies with
	short stalks formed. When a small percentage of cpnA- cells was mixed
	with wild-type cells, the cpnA- cells labeled with GFP were found
	located throughout the chimeric slug and in both the stalk and sporehead
	of the fruiting bodies. However, there appeared to be a small bias
	towards cpnA- cells becoming spore cells. When cpnA- cells were developed
	in buffer containing EGTA, they were also able to differentiate into
	either stalk or spore cells to form fruiting bodies with short stalks.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CpnA is involved in the regulation
	of aggregation, slug size, and culmination during Dictyostelium development.
	More specifically, CpnA appears to be involved in the function and
	differentiation of prestalk cells and plays a role in a calcium-regulated
	signaling pathway critical to triggering the initiation of culmination.},

	First, a two-chamber device, divided by a porous membrane, allows

	attracts the cells toward the surface where they synchronously spread

	synthase (TS), we evaluated (1) whether DIF-1 could effectively regulate
	these genes, (2) whether it could interfere with cell viability,
	and (3) whether DIF-1 activity could enhance the efficacy of the
	TS inhibitor 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). METHODS: We investigated the
	effects of DIF-1 in continuous human cell lines derived from two
	oral tumor histotypes (corresponding to an adenosquamous and a squamous
	carcinoma) and a gingival epithelium. We evaluated mRNA accumulation
	by means of quantitative real-time PCR and efficacy of drugs on cell
	viability by means of MTT assay. RESULTS: DIF-1 inhibited the accumulation
	of E2F1 mRNA and reduces TS mRNA levels in tumor cell lines, but
	did not alter mRNA levels in the gingival counterpart. As a result,
	it inhibited proliferation preferentially of tumor cell in time-
	and concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, it enhanced cytotoxic
	effects of 5-FU only in tumor cell, whereas reduced them in the gingival
	counterpart. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a tumor-specific
	action of DIF-1 on oral carcinoma cells. Thus, interfering with E2F1
	and TS transcription, DIF-1 potentiates TS enzymatic inhibitors.},

	by their adhesive properties and other cellular factors. DdCAD-1
	is a unique homophilic cell adhesion molecule encoded by the cadA

	membrane by contractile vacuoles. In chimeras developed on soil plates,
	DdCAD-1-expressing cells showed greater propensity to develop into
	spores than did cadA-null cells. When development was performed on
	non-nutrient agar, wild-type cells sorted from the cadA-null cells
	and moved to the anterior zone. They differentiated mostly into stalk
	cells and eventually died, whereas the cadA-null cells survived as
	spores. To assess the role of DdCAD-1 in this novel behavior of wild-type
	and mutant cells, cadA-null cells were rescued by the ectopic expression
	of DdCAD-1-GFP. Morphological studies have revealed major spatiotemporal
	changes in the subcellular distribution of DdCAD-1 during development.
	Whereas DdCAD-1 became internalized in most cells in the post-aggregation
	stages, it was prominent in the contact regions of anterior cells.
	Cell sorting was also restored in cadA(-) slugs by exogenous recombinant
	DdCAD-1. Remarkably, DdCAD-1 remained on the surface of anterior
	cells, whereas it was internalized in the posterior cells. Additionally,
	DdCAD-1-expressing cells migrated slower than cadA(-) cells and sorted
	to the anterior region of chimeric slugs. These results show that
	DdCAD-1 influences the sorting behavior of cells in slugs by its
	differential distribution on the prestalk and prespore cells.},

  abstract = {Dictyostelium discoideum has been very useful for elucidating principles
	of development over the last 50 years, but a key attribute means
	there is a lot to be learned from a very different intellectual tradition:
	social evolution. Because Dictyostelium arrives at multicellularity
	by aggregation instead of through a single-cell bottleneck, the multicellular
	body could be made up of genetically distinct cells. If they are
	genetically distinct, natural selection will result in conflict over
	which cells become fertile spores and which become dead stalk cells.
	Evidence for this conflict includes unequal representation of two
	genetically different clones in spores of a chimera, the poison-like
	differentiation inducing factor (DIF) system that appears to involve
	some cells forcing others to become stalk, and reduced functionality
	in migrating chimeras. Understanding how selection operates on chimeras
	of genetically distinct clones is crucial for a comprehensive view
	of Dictyostelium multicellularity. In nature, Dictyostelium fruiting
	bodies are often clonal, or nearly so, meaning development will often
	be very cooperative. Relatedness levels tell us what benefits must
	be present for sociality to evolve. Therefore it is important to
	measure relatedness in nature, show that it has an impact on cooperation
	in the laboratory, and investigate genes that Dictyostelium uses
	to discriminate between relatives and non-relatives. Clearly, there
	is a promising future for research at the interface of development

	The social stage of Dictylostelium discoideum occurs when the amoebae
	run out of their bacterial prey and aggregate into a multicellular,
	motile slug. This slug forms a fruiting body in which about a fifth
	of cells die to form a stalk that supports the remaining cells as
	they form hardy dispersal-ready spores. Because this social stage
	forms from aggregation, it is analogous to a social group, or a chimeric
	multicellular organism, and is vulnerable to internal conflict. Advances
	in cell labeling, microscopy, single-gene knockouts, and genomics,
	as well as the results of decades of study of D. discoideum as a
	model for development, allow us to explore the genetic basis of social
	contests and control of cheaters in unprecedented detail. Cheaters
	are limited from exploiting other clones by high relatedness, kin
	discrimination, pleiotropy, noble resistance, and lottery-like role
	assignment. The active nature of these limits is reflected in the
	elevated rates of change in social genes compared with nonsocial
	genes. Despite control of cheaters, some conflict is still expressed
	in chimeras, with slower movement of slugs, slightly decreased investment
	in stalk compared with spore cells, and differential contributions

	63kDa cyrA is cleaved into two major C-terminal fragments, cyrA-C45

	CaM-agarose binding and CaM immunoprecipitation verified that cyrA-C45

	extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM purification verified the presence

	repeat sequence of cyrA (EGFL1) that is present in both cyrA-C45
	and -C40 enhances both random cell motility and cAMP-mediated chemotaxis.

	of Amoebozoa that achieve multicellularity by aggregation and undergo
	morphogenesis into fruiting bodies with terminally differentiated
	spores and stalk cells. There are four groups of dictyostelids, with

	discoideum. RESULTS: We have produced a draft genome sequence of
	another group dictyostelid, Dictyostelium purpureum, and compare
	it to the D. discoideum genome. The assembly (8.41 x coverage) comprises
	799 scaffolds totaling 33.0 Mb, comparable to the D. discoideum genome
	size. Sequence comparisons suggest that these two dictyostelids shared
	a common ancestor approximately 400 million years ago. In spite of
	this divergence, most orthologs reside in small clusters of conserved
	synteny. Comparative analyses revealed a core set of orthologous
	genes that illuminate dictyostelid physiology, as well as differences
	in gene family content. Interesting patterns of gene conservation
	and divergence are also evident, suggesting function differences;
	some protein families, such as the histidine kinases, have undergone
	little functional change, whereas others, such as the polyketide
	synthases, have undergone extensive diversification. The abundant
	amino acid homopolymers encoded in both genomes are generally not
	found in homologous positions within proteins, so they are unlikely
	to derive from ancestral DNA triplet repeats. Genes involved in the
	social stage evolved more rapidly than others, consistent with either
	relaxed selection or accelerated evolution due to social conflict.
	CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this new genome sequence and comparative
	analysis shed light on the biology and evolution of the Dictyostelia.},

  abstract = {Dictyostelium is the only non-metazoan with functionally analyzed
	SH2 domains and studying them can give insights into their evolution
	and wider potential. LrrB has a novel domain configuration with leucine-rich
	repeat, 14-3-3 and SH2 protein-protein interaction modules. It is
	required for the correct expression of several specific genes in
	early development and here we characterize its role in later, multicellular
	development. During development in the light, slug formation in LrrB
	null (lrrB-) mutants is delayed relative to the parental strain,
	and the slugs are highly defective in phototaxis and thermotaxis.
	In the dark the mutant arrests development as an elongated mound,
	in a hitherto unreported process we term dark stalling. The developmental
	and phototaxis defects are cell autonomous and marker analysis shows
	that the pstO prestalk sub-region of the slug is aberrant in the
	lrrB- mutant. Expression profiling, by parallel micro-array and deep
	RNA sequence analyses, reveals many other alterations in prestalk-specific
	gene expression in lrrB- slugs, including reduced expression of the
	ecmB gene and elevated expression of ampA. During culmination ampA
	is ectopically expressed in the stalk, there is no expression of
	ampA and ecmB in the lower cup and the mutant fruiting bodies lack
	a basal disc. The basal disc cup derives from the pstB cells and
	this population is greatly reduced in the lrrB- mutant. This anatomical
	feature is a hallmark of mutants aberrant in signaling by DIF-1,
	the polyketide that induces prestalk and stalk cell differentiation.
	In a DIF-1 induction assay the lrrB- mutant is profoundly defective
	in ecmB activation but only marginally defective in ecmA induction.
	Thus the mutation partially uncouples these two inductive events.
	In early development LrrB interacts physically and functionally with
	CldA, another SH2 domain containing protein. However, the CldA null
	mutant does not phenocopy the lrrB- in its aberrant multicellular
	development or phototaxis defect, implying that the early and late
	functions of LrrB are affected in different ways. These observations,
	coupled with its domain structure, suggest that LrrB is an SH2 adaptor
	protein active in diverse developmental signaling pathways.},

	development, is important for morphogenesis and regulated gene expression
	in the multicellular context and is required to trigger cell-differentiation.
	G-protein linked adenylyl cyclase pathways are crucially involved
	and a mutant lacking the aggregation specific adenylyl cyclase ACA
	does not undergo multicellular development. RESULTS: Here, we have
	investigated the role of cyclase-associated protein (CAP), an important
	regulator of cell polarity and F-actin/G-actin ratio in the aca mutant.
	We show that ectopic expression of GFP-CAP improves cell polarization,
	streaming and aggregation in aca cells, but it fails to completely
	restore development. Our studies indicate a requirement of CAP in
	the ACA dependent signal transduction for progression of the development
	of unicellular amoebae into multicellular structures. The reduced
	expression of the cell adhesion molecule DdCAD1 together with csA
	is responsible for the defects in aca cells to initiate multicellular
	development. Early development was restored by the expression of
	GFP-CAP that enhanced the DdCAD1 transcript levels and to a lesser
	extent the csA mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data shows
	a novel role of CAP in regulating cell adhesion mechanisms during
	development that might be envisioned to unravel the functions of
	mammalian CAP during animal embryogenesis.},

	and modify cell shape. During cytokinesis or eukaryotic cell crawling,
	contractile forces are generated inside the cell to constrict the
	division site or to haul the rear of the cell forward, respectively.
	In many cases, these forces have been attributed to the activity
	of molecular motors, such as myosin II, which, by pulling on actin
	filaments, can produce contraction of the actin cytoskeleton. However,
	prokaryotic division is driven by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ and
	does not seem to require additional molecular motors to constrict
	the division site. Likewise, Dictyostelium discoideum and Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae can perform cytokinesis under motor-free conditions. In
	addition, many crawling cells can translocate when myosin is inhibited
	or absent. In this review, we point out another force-generation
	mechanism that can play a significant role in driving these processes
	in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This mechanism is mediated by cross-linking
	and bundling proteins that form effective interactions between cytoskeletal
	filaments. Some recent studies in this area are reviewed and the
	physical underpinnings of this force-generation mechanism are explained.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transcription factors of the LSF/Grainyhead (GRH)
	family are characterized by the possession of a distinctive DNA-binding
	domain that bears no clear relationship to other known DNA-binding
	domains, with the possible exception of the p53 core domain. In triploblastic
	animals, the LSF and GRH subfamilies have diverged extensively with
	respect to their biological roles, general expression patterns, and
	mechanism of DNA binding. For example, Grainyhead (GRH) homologs
	are expressed primarily in the epidermis, and they appear to play
	an ancient role in maintaining the epidermal barrier. By contrast,
	LSF homologs are more widely expressed, and they regulate general
	cellular functions such as cell cycle progression and survival in
	addition to cell-lineage specific gene expression. RESULTS: To illuminate
	the early evolution of this family and reconstruct the functional
	divergence of LSF and GRH, we compared homologs from 18 phylogenetically
	diverse taxa, including four basal animals (Nematostella vectensis,
	Vallicula multiformis, Trichoplax adhaerens, and Amphimedon queenslandica),
	a choanoflagellate (Monosiga brevicollis) and several fungi. Phylogenetic
	and bioinformatic analyses of these sequences indicate that (1) the
	LSF/GRH gene family originated prior to the animal-fungal divergence,
	and (2) the functional diversification of the LSF and GRH subfamilies
	occurred prior to the divergence between sponges and eumetazoans.
	Aspects of the domain architecture of LSF/GRH proteins are well conserved
	between fungi, choanoflagellates, and metazoans, though within the
	Metazoa, the LSF and GRH families are clearly distinct. We failed
	to identify a convincing LSF/GRH homolog in the sequenced genomes
	of the algae Volvox carteri and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii or the
	amoebozoan Dictyostelium purpureum. Interestingly, the ancestral
	GRH locus has become split into two separate loci in the sea anemone
	Nematostella, with one locus encoding a DNA binding domain and the
	other locus encoding the dimerization domain. CONCLUSIONS: In metazoans,
	LSF and GRH proteins play a number of roles that are essential to
	achieving and maintaining multicellularity. It is now clear that
	this protein family already existed in the unicellular ancestor of
	animals, choanoflagellates, and fungi. However, the diversification
	of distinct LSF and GRH subfamilies appears to be a metazoan invention.
	Given the conserved role of GRH in maintaining epithelial integrity
	in vertebrates, insects, and nematodes, it is noteworthy that the
	evolutionary origin of Grh appears roughly coincident with the evolutionary
	origin of the epithelium.},

	with surrounding cells and the extracellular matrix such that they
	transverse three-dimensionally. For this reason, three-dimensional
	matrices have become more and more popular for cell migration experiments.
	In addition, recent developments in imaging techniques have enabled
	high resolution observations of in vivo cell migration. The combination
	of three-dimensional matrices and such imaging techniques has revealed
	motile mechanisms in tissues not observable in studies using planar
	surfaces. Regarding models for such cell migration studies, the cellular

  abstract = {Infection of Dictyostelium discoideum with Legionella pneumophila
	resulted in a large number of differentially regulated genes among
	them three core autophagy genes, ATG8, ATG9 and ATG16. Macroautophagy
	contributes to many physiological and pathological processes and
	might also constitute an important mechanism in cell-autonomous immunity.
	For further studies we selected the highly conserved ATG9. In colocalization
	studies with GFP-tagged ATG9 and different organelle marker proteins
	we neither observed colocalization with mitochondria, the ER nor
	lysosomes. However, there was partial colocalization with the Golgi
	apparatus and many ATG9-GFP-containing vesicles localized along microtubules
	and accumulated around the microtubule organizing centre. ATG9-deficient
	cells had pleiotropic defects. In addition to growth defects they
	displayed severe developmental defects, consistent with the known
	role of autophagy in Dictyostelium development. Unexpectedly, the
	ATG9 mutant also had a strong phagocytosis defect that was particularly
	apparent when infecting the cells with L. pneumophila. However, those
	Legionellae that entered the host could multiply better in mutant
	than in wild-type cells, because of a less efficient clearance in
	the early and a more efficient replication in the late phase of infection.
	We conclude that ATG9 and hence macroautophagy has a protective role
	during pathogen infection.},

	a unique opportunity to study the de novo formation of vacuoles because,
	in its life cycle, a subset of the highly motile animal-like cells
	(prestalk cells) rapidly develops a single large vacuole and cellulosic
	cell wall to become plant-like cells (stalk cells). Here we describe
	the origin and process of vacuole formation using live-imaging of
	Dictyostelium cells expressing GFP-tagged ammonium transporter A
	(AmtA-GFP), which was found to reside on the membrane of stalk-cell
	vacuoles. We show that stalk-cell vacuoles originate from acidic
	vesicles and autophagosomes, which fuse to form autolysosomes. Their
	repeated fusion and expansion accompanied by concomitant cell wall
	formation enable the stalk cells to rapidly develop turgor pressure
	necessary to make the rigid stalk to hold the spores aloft. Contractile
	vacuoles, which are rich in H(+)-ATPase as in plant vacuoles, remained
	separate from these vacuoles. We further argue that AmtA may play
	an important role in the control of stalk-cell differentiation by
	modulating the pH of autolysosomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heavy chain phosphorylation plays a central role in regulating
	myosin II bipolar filament assembly in Dictyostelium, as well as
	in higher eukaryotic nonmuscle cells. Our previous work has demonstrated
	that the WD-repeat domain of Dictyostelium myosin II heavy chain
	kinase B (MHCK-B), unlike its counterpart in MHCK-A, is not absolutely
	required for targeting of the kinase to phosphorylate MHC. Thus,
	we tested the hypothesis that an asparagine-rich and structurally
	disordered region that is unique to MHCK-B can by itself function
	in substrate targeting. FINDINGS: Biochemical assays comparing the
	activities of full-length MHCK-B, a truncation lacking only the WD-repeat
	domain (B-Delta-WD), and a truncation lacking both the N-rich region
	and the WD-repeat domain (B-Delta-N-WD) revealed that the N-rich
	region targets MHCK-B to phosphorylate MHC in a manner that leads
	to bipolar filament disassembly. This targeting is physiologically
	relevant since cellular over-expression of the B-Delta-WD truncation,
	but not the B-Delta-N-WD truncation, leads to dramatically reduced
	levels of myosin II filament assembly and associated defects in cytokinesis
	and multicellular development. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented
	here demonstrate that an intrinsically unstructured, and asparagine-rich,
	region of a MHCK-B can mediate specific targeting of the kinase to
	phosphorylate myosin II heavy chain. This targeting involves a direct
	binding interaction with myosin II filaments. In terms of regulating
	myosin bipolar filament assembly, our results suggest that factors
	affecting the activity of this unique region of MHCK-B could allow
	for regulation of MHCK-B in a manner that is distinct from the other
	MHCKs in Dictyostelium.},

	Comparison with rhodamine-phalloidin staining in fixed cells demonstrated

	the rear cortex and cleavage furrows, where actin filaments are stretched
	by interaction with endogenous myosin II filaments. The GFP-S1 probes
	were similarly enriched in the cortex stretched passively by traction

	Previous work identified an essential sequence motif within region

	slower migration toward the chemoattractant cAMP and contained lower
	levels of cortical myosin II, which is likely due to defects in dephosphorylation
	of myosin II mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). htt(-) cells
	also failed to maintain myosin II in the cortex of the cleavage furrow,
	generating unseparated daughter cells connected through a thin cytoplasmic
	bridge. Furthermore, similar to Dictyostelium htt(-) cells, siRNA-mediated
	knockdown of human HTT also decreased the PP2A activity in HeLa cells.
	Our data indicate that Htt regulates the phosphorylation status of
	myosin II during chemotaxis and cytokinesis through PP2A.},

  abstract = {O(2) regulates multicellular development of the social amoeba Dictyostelium,
	suggesting it may serve as an important cue in its native soil environment.
	Dictyostelium expresses an HIFalpha-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H1)
	whose levels affect the O(2)-threshold for culmination implicating
	it as a direct O(2)-sensor, as in animals. But Dictyostelium lacks
	HIFalpha, a mediator of animal prolyl 4-hydroxylase signaling, and
	P4H1 can hydroxylate Pro143 of Skp1, a subunit of E3(SCF)ubiquitin-ligases.
	Skp1 hydroxyproline then becomes the target of five sequential glycosyltransferase
	reactions that modulate the O(2)-signal. Here we show that genetically
	induced changes in Skp1 levels also affect the O(2)-threshold, in
	opposite direction to that of the modification enzymes suggesting
	that the latter reduce Skp1 activity. Consistent with this, overexpressed
	Skp1 is poorly hydroxylated and Skp1 is the only P4H1 substrate detectable
	in extracts. Effects of Pro143 mutations, and of combinations of
	Skp1 and enzyme level perturbations, are consistent with pathway
	modulation of Skp1 activity. However, some effects were not mirrored
	by changes in modification of the bulk Skp1 pool, implicating a Skp1
	subpopulation and possibly additional unknown factors. Altered Skp1
	levels also affected other developmental transitions in a modification-dependent
	fashion. Whereas hydroxylation of animal HIFalpha results in its
	polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, Dictyostelium Skp1
	levels were little affected by its modification status. These data
	indicate that Skp1 and possibly E3(SCF)ubiquitin-ligase activity
	modulate O(2)-dependent culmination and other developmental processes,
	and at least partially mediate the action of the hydroxylation/glycosylation
	pathway in O(2)-sensing.},

	which hydrolyzes extracellular di- and triphosphate nucleotides,
	and ecto-5'-nucleotidase, which hydrolyzes AMP, have been characterized
	in T. vaginalis. The aim of this study was to characterize the adenosine
	deaminase (ADA) activity in intact trophozoites of T. vaginalis.
	A strong inhibition in adenosine deamination was observed in the
	presence of calcium and magnesium, which was prevented by EDTA. The
	apparent K(M) value for adenosine was 1.13 +/- 0.07mM. The calculated
	V(max) was 2.61 +/- 0.054 nmol NH(3) min(-1) mg(-1) protein. Adenosine
	deamination was inhibited in the presence of erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine.
	Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments were performed
	and both ADA-related genes ada(125) and ada(231) mRNA were expressed,
	although ada(231) in higher quantity when compared with the ada(125)
	: alpha-tubulin ratio. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis showed
	that the T. vaginalis sequences formed a clade with Entamoeba histolytica
	and Dictyostelium discoideum sequences, and it strongly suggests
	homologous functions in the T. vaginalis genome. The presence of
	ADA activity in T. vaginalis may be important to modulate the adenosine/inosine
	levels during infection and, consequently, to maintain the anti-inflammatory
	properties through different nucleoside-signalling mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The social amoeba Dictyostelium expresses a hypoxia inducible factor-alpha
	(HIFalpha) type prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H1) and an alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
	(Gnt1) that sequentially modify proline-143 of Skp1, a subunit of
	the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein) class of E3 ubiquitin ligases.
	Prior genetic studies have implicated Skp1 and its modification by
	these enzymes in O(2) regulation of development, suggesting the existence
	of an ancient O(2)-sensing mechanism related to modification of the
	transcription factor HIFalpha by animal prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs).
	To better understand the role of Skp1 in P4H1-dependent O(2) signaling,
	biochemical and biophysical studies were conducted to characterize
	the reaction product and the basis of Skp1 substrate selection by
	P4H1 and Gnt1. (1)H NMR demonstrated formation of 4(trans)-hydroxyproline
	as previously found for HIFalpha, and highly purified P4H1 was inhibited
	by Krebs cycle intermediates and other compounds that affect animal
	P4Hs. However, in contrast to hydroxylation of HIFalpha by PHDs,
	P4H1 depended on features of full-length Skp1, based on truncation,
	mutagenesis, and competitive inhibition studies. These features are
	conserved during animal evolution, as even mammalian Skp1, which
	lacks the target proline, became a good substrate upon its restoration.
	P4H1 recognition may depend on features conserved for SCF complex
	formation as heterodimerization with an F-box protein blocked Skp1
	hydroxylation. The hydroxyproline-capping enzyme Gnt1 exhibited similar
	requirements for Skp1 as a substrate. These and other findings support
	a model in which the protist P4H1 conditionally hydroxylates Skp1
	of E3(SCF)ubiquitin ligases to control half-lives of multiple targets,
	rather than the mechanism of animal PHDs where individual proteins
	are hydroxylated leading to ubiquitination by the evolutionarily
	related E3(VBC)ubiquitin ligases.},

	O(2) for informational purposes in addition to utilizing it for oxidative
	metabolism. Whereas low O(2) suffices for proliferation, a higher
	level is required for slugs to culminate into fruiting bodies, and
	O(2) influences slug polarity, slug migration, and cell-type proportioning.
	Dictyostelium expresses a cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H1)
	known to mediate O(2)-sensing in animals, but lacks HIFalpha, a major
	hydroxylation target whose accumulation directly induces animal hypoxia-dependent
	transcriptional changes. The O(2)-requirement for culmination is
	increased by P4H1-gene disruption and reduced by P4H1 overexpression.
	A target of Dictyostelium P4H1 is Skp1, a subunit of the SCF-class
	of E3-ubiquitin ligases related to the VBC-class that mediates hydroxylation-dependent
	degradation of animal HIFalpha. Skp1 is a target of a novel cytoplasmic
	O-glycosylation pathway that modifies HyPro143 with a pentasaccharide,
	and glycosyltransferase mutants reveal that glycosylation intermediates
	have antagonistic effects toward P4H1 in O(2)-signaling. Current
	evidence indicates that Skp1 is the only glycosylation target in

	mediate O(2)-signaling in hierarchical fashion via Skp1 to control
	the proteome, directly via degradation rather than indirectly via

	proper function of many cellular processes, including cell migration.
	One type of cell migration, referred to as amoeboid motility, involves
	alternating cycles of morphological expansion and retraction. Traditionally,
	this process has been characterized by a number of parameters providing
	global information about shape changes, which are insufficient to
	distinguish phenotypes based on local pseudopodial activities that
	typify amoeboid motility. RESULTS: We developed a method that automatically
	detects and characterizes pseudopodial behavior of cells. The method
	uses skeletonization, a technique from morphological image processing
	to reduce a shape into a series of connected lines. It involves a
	series of automatic algorithms including image segmentation, boundary
	smoothing, skeletonization and branch pruning, and takes into account
	the cell shape changes between successive frames to detect protrusion
	and retraction activities. In addition, the activities are clustered
	into different groups, each representing the protruding and retracting
	history of an individual pseudopod. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate the
	algorithms on movies of chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells and show
	that our method makes it possible to capture the spatial and temporal
	dynamics as well as the stochastic features of the pseudopodial behavior.
	Thus, the method provides a powerful tool for investigating amoeboid

  abstract = {Many eukaryotic cells can detect gradients of chemical signals in
	their environments and migrate accordingly (1). This guided cell
	migration is referred as chemotaxis, which is essential for various
	cells to carry out their functions such as trafficking of immune
	cells and patterning of neuronal cells (2, 3). A large family of
	G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) detects variable small peptides,
	known as chemokines, to direct cell migration in vivo (4). The final
	goal of chemotaxis research is to understand how a GPCR machinery
	senses chemokine gradients and controls signaling events leading
	to chemotaxis. To this end, we use imaging techniques to monitor,
	in real time, spatiotemporal concentrations of chemoattractants,
	cell movement in a gradient of chemoattractant, GPCR mediated activation
	of heterotrimeric G-protein, and intracellular signaling events involved
	in chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells (5-8). The simple eukaryotic organism,
	Dictyostelium discoideum, displays chemotaxic behaviors that are
	similar to those of leukocytes, and D. discoideum is a key model
	system for studying eukaryotic chemotaxis. As free-living amoebae,
	D. discoideum cells divide in rich medium. Upon starvation, cells
	enter a developmental program in which they aggregate through cAMP-mediated
	chemotaxis to form multicullular structures. Many components involved
	in chemotaxis to cAMP have been identified in D. discoideum. The
	binding of cAMP to a GPCR (cAR1) induces dissociation of heterotrimeric
	G-proteins into Ggamma and Gbetagamma subunits (7, 9, 10). Gbetagamma
	subunits activate Ras, which in turn activates PI3K, converting PIP(2;)
	into PIP(3;) on the cell membrane (11-13). PIP(3;) serve as binding
	sites for proteins with pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains, thus recruiting
	these proteins to the membrane (14, 15). Activation of cAR1 receptors
	also controls the membrane associations of PTEN, which dephosphorylates
	PIP(3;) to PIP(2;)(16, 17). The molecular mechanisms are evolutionarily
	conserved in chemokine GPCR-mediated chemotaxis of human cells such
	as neutrophils (18). We present following methods for studying chemotaxis
	of D. discoideum cells. 1. Preparation of chemotactic component cells.
	2. Imaging chemotaxis of cells in a cAMP gradient. 3. Monitoring
	a GPCR induced activation of heterotrimeric G-protein in single live
	cells. 4. Imaging chemoattractant-triggered dynamic PIP(3;) responses

	factors for full inducibility. We perform genome-wide microarray
	analyses, on parental, mybE- and dimB- cells, and identify many additional
	genes that depend on MybE and DimB for their DIF-1 inducibility.
	Surprisingly, an even larger number of genes are only DIF inducible
	in mybE- cells, some genes are only inducible in DimB- cells and
	some are inducible when either transcription factor is absent. Thus
	in assay conditions where MybE and DimB function as inducers of ecmA
	these genes fall under negative control by the same two transcription
	factors. We have studied in detail rtaA, one of the MybE and DimB
	repressed genes. One especially enigmatic group of prestalk cells
	is the anterior-like cells (ALCs), which exist intermingled with
	prespore cells in the slug. A promoter fusion reporter gene, rtaA:gal(u),
	is expressed in a subset of the ALCs that is distinct from the ALC
	population detected by a reporter construct containing ecmA and ecmB
	promoter fragments. At culmination, when the ALC sort out from the
	prespore cells and differentiate to form three ancillary stalk cell
	structures: the upper cup, the lower cup and the outer basal disk,
	the rtaA:gal(u) expressing cells preferentially populate the upper
	cup region. This fact, and their virtual absence from the anterior

	sub-type: the pstU cells. PstU cell differentiation is, as expected,
	increased in a dimB- mutant during normal development but, surprisingly,
	they differentiate normally in a mutant lacking DIF. Thus genetic
	removal of MybE or DimB reveals an alternate DIF-1 activation pathway,
	for pstU differentiation, that functions under monolayer assay conditions
	but that is not essential during multicellular development.},

	assess the potential of a novel cancer chemotherapy based on the
	pharmacological effect of DIF-1, we investigated whether DIF-1 exhibits

	only inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial
	cells (HUVECs) by restricting cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and degrading
	cyclin D1, but also inhibited the ability of HUVECs to form capillaries
	and migrate. Moreover, DIF-1 suppressed VEGF- and cancer cell-induced
	neovascularization in Matrigel plugs injected subcutaneously to murine
	flank. Subsequently, we attempted to identify the mechanism behind
	the anti-angiogenic effects of DIF-1. We showed that DIF-1 strongly

	sensing in animals via modification of the transcriptional factor
	subunit HIFalpha, resulting in its polyubiquitination by the E3(VHL)ubiquitin
	(Ub) ligase and degradation in the 26 S proteasome. Previously thought
	to be restricted to animals, a homolog (P4H1) of HIFalpha-type PHDs
	is expressed in the social amoeba Dictyostelium where it also exhibits
	characteristics of an O(2) sensor for development. Dictyostelium
	lacks HIFalpha, and P4H1 modifies a different protein, Skp1, an adaptor
	of the SCF class of E3-Ub ligases related to the E3(VHL)Ub ligase
	that targets animal HIFalpha. Normally, the HO-Skp1 product of the
	P4H1 reaction is capped by a GlcNAc sugar that can be subsequently
	extended to a pentasaccharide by novel glycosyltransferases. To analyze
	the role of glycosylation, the Skp1 GlcNAc-transferase locus gnt1
	was modified with a missense mutation to block catalysis or a stop
	codon to truncate the protein. Despite the accumulation of the hydroxylated
	form of Skp1, Skp1 was not destabilized based on metabolic labeling.
	However, hydroxylation alone allowed for partial correction of the
	high O(2) requirement of P4H1-null cells, therefore revealing both
	glycosylation-independent and glycosylation-dependent roles for hydroxylation.
	Genetic complementation of the latter function required an enzymatically
	active form of Gnt1. Because the effect of the gnt1 deficiency depended
	on P4H1, and Skp1 was the only protein labeled when the GlcNAc-transferase
	was restored to mutant extracts, Skp1 apparently mediates the cellular
	functions of both P4H1 and Gnt1. Although Skp1 stability itself is
	not affected by hydroxylation, its modification may affect the stability
	of targets of Skp1-dependent Ub ligases.},

	signaling for directional sensing and pseudopod extension at the

	signal is translated into remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is
	poorly understood. Here, using a proteomics approach, we identified
	multiple PtdInsP(3)-binding proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum,
	including five pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins.
	Two of these, the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B and
	the PH domain-containing protein PhdA, were previously characterized
	as PtdInsP(3)-binding proteins. In addition, PhdB, PhdG, and PhdI
	were identified as previously undescribed PH domain-containing proteins.
	Specific PtdInsP(3) interactions with PhdB, PhdG, and PhdI were confirmed
	using an in vitro lipid-binding assay. In cells, PhdI associated
	with the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on both the PH domain
	and PtdInsP(3). Consistent with this finding, PhdI located to the
	leading edge in migrating cells. In contrast, PhdG was found in the
	cytosol in WT cells. However, when PtdInsP(3) was overproduced in
	pten(-) cells, PhdG located to the plasma membrane, suggesting its
	weak affinity for PtdInsP(3). PhdB was found to bind to the plasma
	membrane via both PtdInsP(3)-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
	The PtdInsP(3)-independent interaction was mediated by the middle
	domain, independent of the PH domain. In migrating cells, the majority
	of PhdB was found at the lagging edge. Finally, we deleted the genes
	encoding PhdB and PhdG and demonstrated that both proteins are required
	for efficient chemotaxis. Thus, this study advances our understanding
	of the PtdInsP(3)-mediated signaling mechanisms that control directed
	cell migration in chemotaxis.},

	We carried out comparative genomic analyses of copper, molybdenum,

	form of selenocysteine) in 747 sequenced organisms at the following
	levels: (i) transporters and transport-related proteins, (ii) cofactor
	biosynthesis traits, and (iii) trace element-dependent proteins.
	Few organisms were found to utilize all five trace elements, whereas
	many symbionts, parasites, and yeasts used only one or none of these
	elements. Investigation of metalloproteomes and selenoproteomes revealed
	examples of increased utilization of proteins that use copper in
	land plants, cobalt in Dehalococcoides and Dictyostelium, and selenium
	in fish and algae, whereas nematodes were found to have great diversity
	of copper transporters. These analyses also characterized trace element
	metabolism in common model organisms and suggested new model organisms
	for experimental studies of individual trace elements. Mismatches
	in the occurrence of user proteins and corresponding transport systems
	revealed deficiencies in our understanding of trace element biology.
	Biological interactions among some trace elements were observed;
	however, such links were limited, and trace elements generally had
	unique utilization patterns. Finally, environmental factors, such
	as oxygen requirement and habitat, correlated with the utilization

	and secretion of the hemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp), virulence
	towards amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum and killing of Escherichia
	coli bacterial cells. We group the 17 proteins characterized in the
	T6SS locus into four categories: twelve (VipA, VipB, VCA0109-VCA0115,
	ClpV, VCA0119, and VasK) are essential for Hcp secretion and bacterial
	virulence, and thus likely function as structural components of the
	apparatus; two (VasH and VCA0122) are regulators that are required
	for T6SS gene expression and virulence; another two, VCA0121 and
	valine-glycine repeat protein G 3 (VgrG-3), are not essential for
	Hcp expression, secretion or bacterial virulence, and their functions
	are unknown; the last group is represented by VCA0118, which is not
	required for Hcp expression or secretion but still plays a role in
	both amoebae and bacterial killing and may therefore be an effector
	protein. We also showed that the clpV gene product is required for
	Dictyostelium virulence but is less important for killing E. coli.
	In addition, one vgrG gene (vgrG-2) outside of the T6SS gene cluster
	was required for bacterial killing but another (vgrG-1) was not.
	However, a bacterial killing defect was observed when vgrG-1 and
	vgrG-3 were both deleted. Several genes encoded in the same putative
	operon as vgrG-1 and vgrG-2 also contribute to virulence toward Dictyostelium
	but have a smaller effect on bacterial killing. Our results provide

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During cytokinesis, regulatory signals are presumed to
	emanate from the mitotic spindle. However, what these signals are
	and how they lead to the spatiotemporal changes in the cortex structure,
	mechanics, and regional contractility are not well understood in
	any system. RESULTS: To investigate pathways that link the microtubule
	network to the cortical changes that promote cytokinesis, we used
	chemical genetics in Dictyostelium to identify genetic suppressors
	of nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizer. We identified 14-3-3
	and found that it is enriched in the cortex, helps maintain steady-state
	microtubule length, contributes to normal cortical tension, modulates
	actin wave formation, and controls the symmetry and kinetics of cleavage
	furrow contractility during cytokinesis. Furthermore, 14-3-3 acts
	downstream of a Rac small GTPase (RacE), associates with myosin II
	heavy chain, and is needed to promote myosin II bipolar thick filament
	remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: 14-3-3 connects microtubules, Rac, and myosin
	II to control several aspects of cortical dynamics, mechanics, and
	cytokinesis cell shape change. Furthermore, 14-3-3 interacts directly
	with myosin II heavy chain to promote bipolar thick filament remodeling
	and distribution. Overall, 14-3-3 appears to integrate several critical
	cytoskeletal elements that drive two important processes-cytokinesis
	cell shape change and cell mechanics.},
